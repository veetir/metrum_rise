# Metrum Rise — UI Architecture

## Paradigm

Hybrid: **top menu bar** for global actions and window launchers + **floating windows** for
information panels and selection-driven properties + **bottom toolbar** for placement tools.

All UI is built procedurally in GDScript. The six `.tscn` files (`MainMenu.tscn`, `Main.tscn`,
`AssetEditor.tscn`, `EconomyEditor.tscn`, `WorldEditor.tscn`, `Router.tscn`) describe the scene node tree but
contain no UI component definitions — all panels, buttons, and windows are constructed at
runtime in `_ready()`. There are no `.tres` theme resource files; style constants are
centralised in `UIStyle` (see below) instead. `WorldEditor.tscn` follows the same procedural-UI
rule as the gameplay and other editor shells.

GDScript is a thin rendering and input bridge only. No simulation logic or game decisions
belong here. Rust methods are called through `SimulationNode`.

### Surface presence per scene

| Surface | MainMenu | Main (gameplay) | AssetEditor | EconomyEditor | WorldEditor |
|---------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Top menu bar | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bottom toolbar | — | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |
| Context panel | — | — | — | — | — |
| Floating windows | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — |

The top menu bar is shared across gameplay and editor scenes. AssetEditor and EconomyEditor remain
self-contained editor applications with no bottom toolbar. WorldEditor is the editor-shell
exception: it uses a bottom toolbar because terrain and later water authoring tools belong on
that surface rather than in the top menu.

MainMenu is the startup exception: it is a dedicated front-door surface and does not instantiate
gameplay UI or a gameplay world.

The top menu in editor scenes carries a reduced item set. AssetEditor and EconomyEditor use
File plus editor-specific menus. WorldEditor uses File plus Help. AssetEditor and WorldEditor have
no `Return To Game` action and no City / Demand / Economy launchers, which are gameplay concepts.

## Surfaces

### 0. Main Menu

**Node:** full-screen `Control`.
**Script:** `scripts/core/main_menu.gd` *(implemented)*.

MainMenu is now the default normal-launch surface. Normal startup must not instantiate a gameplay
map before the player chooses content.

Current deterministic rules:

- normal launch routes to `MainMenu.tscn`
- startup creates `user://worlds/`, `user://mods/`, and `user://saves/`, then copies missing
  bundled starter entries from `res://bootstrap/worlds/` and `res://bootstrap/mods/`
- when `user://settings.cfg` is missing, startup seeds default general UI/runtime settings
- when `user://active_packs.cfg` is missing, startup seeds it with the bundled `kenney` pack
  enabled; a saved empty enabled-pack list remains an explicit player choice
- `MainMenu` contains no `SimulationNode`
- `MainMenu` contains no terrain, water, road, or gameplay HUD surfaces
- `New Game` opens a file picker rooted at `user://worlds/`
- `Load Game` opens a file picker rooted at `user://saves/`
- selecting a world or save stores the request in the `LaunchState` autoload and then enters
  `Main.tscn`
- `Main.tscn` must consume that pending request on startup and load the selected world/save before
  gameplay continues
- if gameplay is opened without a pending request and without benchmark-style command-line flags,
  it returns to `MainMenu.tscn`

MainMenu v1 actions:

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| New Game | Pick a `WorldDefinition` from `user://worlds/` and enter gameplay |
| Load Game | Pick a city save from `user://saves/` and enter gameplay |
| World Editor | Spawn a `--world-editor` instance |
| Options | Open the shared options window |
| Quit | Exit the application |

### 1. Top Menu Bar

**Node:** `MenuBar` anchored `PRESET_TOP_WIDE`, height ~28 px.
**Script:** `scripts/ui/top_menu.gd` *(implemented)*.

| Menu   | Items |
|--------|-------|
| File   | New Game, Save `[Ctrl+S]`, Load `[Ctrl+L]`, —, Options, —, Quit |
| View   | Overlays submenu (None `[7]`, Pollution `[8]`, Noise `[9]`, Desirability `[0]`, Deposits `[-]`), — , Toggle Zoning Overlay |
| City   | City Statistics *(window)*, Economy Overview *(window)*, Demand Overview *(window)* |
| Tools  | Open Asset Editor, Open Economy Editor |
| Help   | Keyboard Shortcuts *(window)*, About |

The menu bar owns global save/load/quit actions. These are currently handled as keyboard
shortcuts in `input_manager.gd`; the keyboard shortcuts remain but the menu provides the
discoverable entry point. Shortcut-bearing items are currently rendered as plain bracketed
text in the label itself (for example `Save [Ctrl+S]`) rather than using a separate
accelerator column.

Gameplay `New Game` still opens a file picker rooted at `user://worlds/` and loads the selected
`WorldDefinition` into the live scene. It resets the camera to the new world's centre and initial
orbit, clears the previous city's save filename, and pauses after rebuilding the scene.
Normal play and debug inspection use the same terrain-anchored focus, initial framing, movement,
and zoom. Debug only extends the orbit pitch to look upward from beneath terrain; the focus
continues to follow the ground while the camera may pass below it in that upward view.
Gameplay `Save` and `Load` open file pickers rooted at `user://saves/`.
City and world-definition saves commit and close an adjacent temporary SQLite file before
replacing the destination. A failed write leaves the previous save intact.
Both city-save and world-definition replacement reset the speed display to paused and close
building inspectors anchored to the previous world. The first pause toggle then resumes play.
Speed requests update the controller/HUD only after the Rust API accepts the command into its
queue. Non-finite values and speeds above 32× are rejected; finite negative values retain pause
clamping. The controls read the existing ascending steps from Rust's clock, which also owns
save-speed validation. The `simulation_speed_input_test.gd` regression is externally time-bounded
because both infinity and huge finite multipliers stalled the old clock loop (`AUDIT-01-C10/C11`).
Asset-editor camera input also calls the shared Rust `CameraNode` directly, with editor-specific
bounds and framing; it keeps no second orbit/transform implementation.

City snapshots also store the active `CameraNode` focus point, yaw, pitch, orbit distance, and
projection in the same SQLite transaction as the world (format version 59). Loading restores
those controls immediately after world replacement, before terrain/water residency refreshes;
the next pan, orbit, or zoom therefore continues from the saved view. The saved focus height
already includes terrain clearance and is restored without another terrain adjustment. Versions
57/58 and simulation-only snapshots have no camera state and keep the scene's current view.
Loading an upward debug view in normal mode clamps its pitch to the normal downward limit.

`top_menu.gd` is attached by each scene root (`Main`, `AssetEditor`, `EconomyEditor`,
`WorldEditor`).
It is not owned by `main_ui.gd`, because the editor scenes do not use the gameplay HUD.

### Options Window

**Node:** draggable Godot `Window`.
**Script:** `scripts/ui/options_window.gd` *(implemented)*.

The same options window is launched from `MainMenu` and from gameplay `File -> Options...`.
It uses a left category rail and right content pane with footer-level `Reset Defaults`,
`Cancel`, and `Apply` actions. General options state is persisted through
`user://settings.cfg` via `scripts/core/game_settings.gd`; the window currently remembers its
last active category plus size and position. The same settings file also stores reusable
`layout/<id>` sections for player-adjusted floating-window sizes, positions where appropriate,
and split-panel offsets such as Economy Overview's budget/service/policy panes. `Accessibility`
owns the runtime-safe `UI Scale`
setting, currently bounded to `80%..150%` in `5%` increments and applied immediately to
scale-aware procedural UI labels/buttons, including gameplay HUD, Options, Building Inspector,
and Economy Overview detail surfaces. Scale-aware floating windows also declare base/default
sizes through `UIStyle`, so window defaults and minimums grow with Accessibility scale and
gently grow on high-resolution viewports while preserving user-resized larger windows and restored
layout values. `Graphics` owns Apply-based `Fullscreen` and `Building detail`
(Performance/Balanced/Quality; default Balanced), persisted through `user://settings.cfg`.
Applying building detail updates live building renderers without reimporting assets; Cancel
discards pending edits and Reset proposes defaults. Detail uses the shared screen-size LOD
policy, not asset-authored distance bands; it changes neither simulation nor visibility.
Display settings apply through the Options footer and on boot. `Mods` embeds the content-pack manager from
`scripts/ui/pack_manager.gd`; pack selection changes are persisted through
`user://active_packs.cfg` and take effect after restart. The previous gameplay toolbar `Mods`
button is intentionally removed so content-pack management lives under global options rather than
construction tools.

WorldEditor menu:

| Menu | Items |
|------|-------|
| File | New World, Open World, Save, Save As, Quit |
| Help | Keyboard Shortcuts, About |

Deterministic rule:

- terrain and water authoring tools do not live in the WorldEditor top menu
- WorldEditor does not expose `Return To Game`

AssetEditor menu:

| Menu | Items |
|------|-------|
| File | New Asset, Save, Quit |
| Asset | Reload Packs, Import Mesh |

Deterministic rule:

- `New Asset` clears the right-side pack/asset/building fields, active preview mesh parts, and mesh part list
  while preserving the explicit comparison ghost
- AssetEditor does not expose `Return To Game`

---

### 2. Bottom Toolbar

**Nodes:** Procedural bottom-strip layout rooted under a full-screen `Control`. The left
gameplay HUD is an `HBoxContainer` of fixed-height `PanelContainer` shells. The right-side
tool menu uses a unified outer group `PanelContainer` plus an inner fixed-height toolbar-row
shell so the submenu stack can read as one cluster while the actual toolbar row still matches
the clock / city-status / RCI strip height.
**Script:** `scripts/ui/main_ui.gd` (current — stays here).

The toolbar is the primary tool-selection surface. It is always visible during gameplay.

| Button  | Activates |
|---------|-----------|
| Roads   | Road sub-menu (Walkway, 2-Lane, 4-Lane, One-Way, Cul-De-Sac) + draw-mode options (Straight / Spline) |
| Zoning  | Zoning sub-menu with one always-visible lower row for Rect / Brush plus Residential / Commercial / Industrial family buttons; the profile row above is collapsed by default and opens only after clicking a family button, which also selects that family's first profile |
| Services | Service-building asset palette for explicit civic / utility placement |
| Industry | Explicit resource-extractor asset palette; selecting an extractor temporarily shows the Deposits overlay through building placement and extraction-polygon drawing; placing a mine switches to extraction-polygon drawing with a pale-blue cursor sphere under the mouse and a live filled preview of the current polygon; the first vertex must start within 10 m of the building footprint and becomes a stronger light-blue close marker, edges may not cross, closing only happens by clicking that first vertex again, the committed polygon is still validated against the building link distance, and committed coal pits render as a terrain-shader coal-texture mask |
| Terrain | Terrain sub-menu for gameplay terrain tools |
| Inspect | Activates `SelectTool`; clicking a building while `SelectTool` is active opens the Building Inspector window |

Bulldoze is intentionally separate from the centered construction toolbar: a bottom-right icon
button activates `BulldozeTool`. Hover asks Rust for exactly one target, prioritizing building
footprints before road edges; left click deletes one target; right click or Esc exits the tool.

Road previews expose full readiness only for the exact current pointer input with a staged
canonical road/terrain pair. Coarse ribbons, retained older poses and missing resident terrain
resources remain visibly provisional (`terrain preview pending`). Cancelling or invalidating a
paired preview restores the original road and terrain resources without changing simulation state.
The complete backend and presentation contract is owned by [`roads.md`](roads.md#preview-query-and-editing).

Sub-menus expand upward above the toolbar row, the same as today. In the current
implementation the right-side menu cluster has:
- one outer translucent group wrapper around the whole menu stack
- one transparent inner layout shell for the actual toolbar row
- fixed-height bottom HUD shells for the clock, city-status panel, and R/C/I meter

Gameplay HUD status widgets: the clock / simulation-speed panel remains anchored at bottom-left,
a compact city-status panel sits immediately to its right, and the R/C/I demand meter sits to
the right of that. The city-status panel shows current treasury value plus live agent count,
and refreshes continuously so paused-state edits such as road building still update the value
immediately. The demand meter shows Residential / Commercial / Industrial net growth pressure
as three vertical bars using the same green / blue / yellow palette as the zoning families.
Each bar is centered on a zero baseline and spans `-100%..100%`. All four bottom-strip surfaces
currently use the same white `HUD_TEXT_SIZE` typography for their primary labels.

Zoning interaction rule: `Rect` and `Brush` are shared paint-mode controls, not their own
submenu. Opening the Zoning tool shows only the lower row. Clicking `Residential`,
`Commercial`, or `Industrial` toggles the profile row for that family above it and
automatically selects the first profile in that family. Clicking the same family again
collapses that profile row.

WorldEditor toolbar rules:

- WorldEditor uses a bottom toolbar with the same bottom-of-screen placement and the same
  `UIStyle` shell language as the gameplay toolbar
- this toolbar is the primary tool-selection surface for world authoring
- terrain tools live here, not in the top menu
- WorldEditor terrain tools are `Raise`, `Lower`, `Level`, `Smooth`, and `Slope`
- selecting `Raise`, `Lower`, `Level`, `Smooth`, or `Slope` opens an upward-expanding terrain brush row above the bottom toolbar shell
- that terrain brush row owns the shared `Diameter m` and `Strength` controls for all terrain brushes
- active terrain brushes must show their diameter directly on the map with a visible brush preview
- `Slope` captures two world-space anchor points before brushing:
  - the first click captures the slope start
  - the second click captures the slope end
  - after both anchors are present, normal terrain brushing applies the captured grade
- `Water` lives on the same toolbar surface as terrain sculpting
- the current water tool set is:
  - `Lake Fill`
  - `Open Water`
- these water tools are world-editor authoring tools, not gameplay HUD tools
- water tools must not be exposed as top-menu actions
- world-editor water authoring must not begin with a freehand water-depth paint brush
- `Resources` lives on the same toolbar surface as terrain and water authoring
- the current resource tool set is:
  - `Coal`
  - `Erase`
- selecting `Resources` opens an upward-expanding tool row with `Diameter m` and `Richness %`
- authored coal is rendered through the terrain overlay texture; it must not use terrain-following
  meshes or decals that can fight the terrain depth buffer
- WorldEditor does not include gameplay-only toolbar actions such as Roads, Zoning, or Inspect
- WorldEditor does not include gameplay HUD widgets such as the clock, city-status panel, or
  R/C/I meter

WorldEditor water toolbar behavior:

- selecting `Water` opens an upward-expanding tool row above the bottom toolbar shell, the same
  visual language used by gameplay submenus
- `Lake Fill` authors one baseline inland-water body seed plus one target flat surface level
- `Open Water` authors one baseline edge-connected water body seed plus one target flat surface
  level
- water authoring belongs on the same bottom-strip workflow as terrain sculpting so authors can
  switch between carving terrain and placing water features without changing editor shells
- committed `Lake Fill` and `Open Water` records, plus any active surface-fill preview, must show
  visible 3D markers in WorldEditor so authored water locations are readable
- these authored-water markers are WorldEditor-only overlays and must not appear in gameplay
- `Lake Fill` and `Open Water` are two-phase actions:
  - first click starts a transient preview
  - the `Surface +m` control adjusts the preview surface
  - the dedicated `OK` button confirms the preview into authored world state
  - the dedicated `Cancel` button or `Escape` dismisses the preview
- `Lake Fill` and `Open Water` preview must represent a flat baseline water surface, not a dynamic
  shallow-water solve
- surface-fill preview is editor-only transient state and is not saved unless confirmed
- invalid surface-fill preview levels must not flood the visible map; they stay preview-only and
  uncommitted until the author adjusts the level or cancels
- `Lake Fill` is only for closed inland basins
- `Open Water` is only for edge-connected water bodies such as coasts, archipelagos, and world-edge
  lakes

Current WorldEditor shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Select `Raise` |
| 2 | Select `Lower` |
| 3 | Select `Level` |
| 4 | Select `Smooth` |
| 5 | Select `Slope` |
| 6 | Select `Lake Fill` |
| 7 | Select `Open Water` |
| 8 | Select `Coal` |
| 9 | Select resource `Erase` |
| Left Mouse | Sculpt terrain with the active tool; `Level` captures the clicked height for the stroke; `Slope` uses the first two clicks to capture anchors before brushing; surface-fill tools use first click for preview; resource tools paint the authored coal layer |
| Shift+Left Mouse | Remove the nearest authored water feature for the active water tool; erase coal while the coal brush is active |
| Middle Mouse | Orbit camera |
| Right Mouse | Pan camera |
| W / A / S / D | Pan camera |
| Mouse Wheel | Zoom camera |
| Ctrl+N | New world |
| Ctrl+O | Open world |
| Ctrl+S | Save world |
| Ctrl+Shift+S | Save world as |
| Escape | Cancel active surface-fill preview, otherwise clear active tool |

**Keyboard shortcuts** (owned by `input_manager.gd`, toolbar reflects active tool visually):

| Key        | Action |
|------------|--------|
| R          | Toggle Road tool |
| X          | Toggle Walkway tool |
| Z          | Toggle Zoning tool |
| M          | Toggle Move tool |
| V          | Toggle Select tool |
| C          | Toggle Cul-De-Sac tool |
| Y          | Toggle Terrain Sculpt |
| Space      | Pause / unpause |
| Escape     | Cancel active tool |
| Ctrl+Z     | Undo |
| F12        | Add 1,000,000 money and lock R/C/I demand at 100% |
| 7 / 8 / 9 / 0 / - | Overlay modes |

**Camera** (owned by `input_manager.gd`):

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Middle Mouse drag | Orbit camera |
| Alt+Left Mouse drag (Option on macOS) | Orbit camera, for a touchpad with no middle button |
| Mouse Wheel | Zoom camera, one step per notch |
| Two-finger scroll (touchpad) | Zoom camera, in fractions of a step |
| Pinch (touchpad) | Zoom camera by the pinch factor |

Godot 4.7.1 dispatches each touchpad gesture twice, so `input_manager.gd` consumes the repeated
copy before any handler sees it. The vegetation brush takes Ctrl (radius) and Shift (option) with
the wheel or a two-finger scroll. macOS turns Shift with a vertical scroll into a horizontal one,
so wheel left and right step the brush like wheel up and down.

---

### 3. Selection Windows

Selection-driven gameplay properties now use floating `Window` surfaces instead of a docked
context panel.

Placement rule: selection windows open near the cursor location that triggered them. They
prefer the right side of the cursor with a small padding so the clicked world-space target
remains visible; if that placement would run off the gameplay viewport, they open on the left
side instead.

| Trigger | Window |
|---------|--------|
| Road edge selected (`SelectTool`) | Road Properties window |
| Building clicked with no active tool | Building Inspector window |
| Building clicked while `SelectTool` is active | Building Inspector window |

Selection gestures (`AUDIT-01-F7`) are owned by `SelectTool`, including lane connections and
crosswalk controls. The inactive duplicate `LaneTool` and its scene node are removed. Tool
switching and right-click clearing cancel both lane and edge gestures. Release is observed before
GUI/unhandled routing; if a later handler consumes it, deferred cleanup cancels without applying
a world edit. A newer press survives that deferred cleanup. Missing world hits clear the ribbon,
and matching edge/lane IDs only clear the source when the target handle is incoming; an outgoing
self-loop handle still creates a connection. Clicks use their event position. Each press or drag
update resolves the terrain hit once, sharing it across control picking.

`selection_gesture_test.gd` sends real viewport input and verifies command identity/counts,
consumed releases, tool changes, right-click cancellation, self-loop direction, crosswalk precedence,
source clearing and continued ordinary edge dragging. Five assertions fail against the old tool;
the corrected tool passes. The consumed-release fixture explicitly verifies interception by a later
input handler; it does not claim window-system mouse capture or focus-loss coverage.

Five alternating matched headless process pairs use Godot 4.7.2, CPU 0, one Rayon worker and
`METRUM_DEBUG=0`. A fixed two-lane junction runs ten warmups and nine samples of 256 drag updates.
The real tool rebuilds its ribbon against controlled simulation responses; assertions outside the
timer check all 22 vertices, both snapped endpoints and the final connection. Median process
medians are 232.121 → 232.113 µs per update, while terrain-query calls fall from two to one. This
isolates GDScript/mesh construction and establishes no whole-frame or native terrain speedup.
Control lookup remains O(local lane/crosswalk handles), and ribbon geometry has ten fixed segments.

Command: `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1 METRUM_DEBUG=0 taskset -c 0 godot --headless --path godot --script res://tests/selection_gesture_test.gd -- --benchmark-selection-drag`.
The before runs add `--tool-path=/tmp/metrum-full-audit/selection-gesture-original-source/godot/scripts/tools/select_tool.gd`.
Both use release extension SHA-256 `f3647c04fc3714b8f84a1f2fa506d3d93417bd47292deb4d22ee13e2b1ad605e`.
Exact script hashes, commands, samples and query counts are in
`/tmp/metrum-full-audit/selection-gesture-{original,after}-identity.json`, `selection-gesture-bench.json`
and `selection-gesture-summary.json`. No builds, tests or source mutations overlapped measurement.
The final scene also corrects its resource load-step count; this metadata is outside the drag fixture.

---

### 4. Floating Windows

Floating windows are Godot `Window` nodes. They use the engine-provided title bar, drag
behavior, and close button, can be open simultaneously, and are dismissed via that close
button or programmatically.

Most windows are instantiated on first open and hidden (not freed) on close so state is
preserved within a session. The Building Inspector is the exception: it creates one window
per inspected building so multiple inspectors can stay open at once, and each is freed when
its close button is used.

| Window | Launcher | Script / status | Content |
|--------|----------|-----------------|---------|
| Options | MainMenu `Options` or gameplay `File -> Options...` | `scripts/ui/options_window.gd` *(implemented)* | Shared options shell with category rail, content pane, footer-level apply/reset/cancel actions, and persisted window state through `user://settings.cfg`. |
| Graphics | Options → Graphics | `scripts/ui/graphics_options.gd` *(implemented)* | Fullscreen/windowed and building-detail presets, persisted through `user://settings.cfg` and applied through the Options footer. |
| Accessibility | Options → Accessibility | `scripts/ui/accessibility_options.gd` *(implemented)* | Embedded UI Scale control, persisted through `user://settings.cfg` and applied immediately to scale-aware procedural UI fonts and eligible floating-window sizes. |
| Building Inspector | Click building with no active tool or while `SelectTool` is active | `scripts/ui/building_inspector.gd` *(implemented)* | Per-building stats: type, level, occupancy, budget, revenue, inventory, extraction-pit reserve/depletion, alerts. Multiple building windows may be open simultaneously; clicking the same building again closes that building's inspector, and visible inspector windows refresh on each in-game hour boundary. Uses Godot's built-in draggable `Window` chrome. |
| Road Properties | Select one or more road edges with `SelectTool` | `scripts/ui/road_properties_window.gd` *(implemented)* | Edge class (Standard / Bridge / Tunnel), No Buildings flag, and slope warnings for the current selection. Uses Godot's built-in draggable `Window` chrome. |
| Mods | Options → Mods | `scripts/ui/pack_manager.gd` *(implemented)* | Embedded content-pack browser / manager panel. |
| City Statistics | City → City Statistics | inline placeholder in `scripts/ui/top_menu.gd` | Placeholder window for future population, housed/unhoused counts, budget summary, and utility status. |
| Economy Overview | City → Economy Overview | `scripts/ui/economy_overview.gd` *(implemented)* | Live fiscal budget, services, and policy overview with persisted window layout and split-panel offsets. |
| Demand Overview | City → Demand Overview | inline placeholder in `scripts/ui/top_menu.gd` | Placeholder window for future residential/commercial/industrial demand pressure, spawn credit, and growth candidates. |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | Help → Keyboard Shortcuts | inline in `scripts/ui/top_menu.gd` *(implemented)* | Read-only shortcut reference. |

Windows that display live simulation data call `SimulationNode` methods each time they are
opened. They do not hold Rust-side state. The Building Inspector additionally refreshes any
visible inspector windows on each in-game hour boundary; other live windows should stay
snapshot-on-open unless there is a clear need for an explicit low-frequency refresh path.

Farm inspectors provide **Edit Field** for committed polygons. `field_edit_tool.gd` displays
the existing vertex handles, previews each drag through Rust validation, and commits on release.
Accepted releases refresh the field overlay and merge Rust's updated area, worker capacity and
production ratio into the open inspector immediately. Rejected moves restore the last accepted
shape and display the conflict. Escape/right-click finishes editing; switching tools or loading
a world also cancels an unfinished drag. No field geometry or economy decisions live in GDScript.
During initial field drawing and resizing, a yellow outline shows the farm lot and a red outline
with translucent fill marks the building/yard footprint the field must avoid. A visible legend
explains the colors. These guides persist until drawing or editing ends and use the authoritative
Rust site geometry, cached once when the tool opens.
See [`economy.md`](economy.md#field-placement-and-editing-econ-07) for land-use rules.
Industry placement clears pending state on deactivation and stops processing while inactive.
Completing a polygon shares that cleanup while preserving the committed farm; placement and
polygon errors appear in the existing tool notification.

Farm inspectors show **Farm Household** occupancy out of one slot, followed by **Children**,
**Adults**, and **Elders**, and the same household money, supplies, and replenishment details as
residential homes. Business workers and production remain in their own section. Counts describe
the resident family, excluding commuting workers, and refresh with the existing hourly inspector
update. Farm housing is independent of the number of jobs (`ECON-08`).

Settings recovery and scaling (`AUDIT-01-F8`) use the default UI scale for NaN/infinite input.
Finite values retain the 0.8–1.5 clamp and 0.05 steps. Failed config reads discard the whole
partially parsed state before defaults are installed; valid reads preserve unrelated layout values.
A font/window refresh reads the scale once and passes it through the existing tree traversal and
size helpers. Later operations still read current settings; there is no persistent settings cache.
Traversal remains O(scene nodes), with one config read rather than one per styled control plus two
per sized window. Font rounding/minimum size, viewport bounds and retained larger windows remain.

`ui_settings_test.gd` verifies normalization, reset versus valid-load preservation, invalid-value
saving, nested font/window sizes and repeated refresh after changing settings. Five assertions fail
on the baseline. A separate native ConfigFile probe confirms that parse failure retains earlier
keys (`ui-settings-probe.log`); the regression exercises the shared recovery helper without emitting
an expected engine parse error in the normal suite.

Five alternating matched headless process pairs use Godot 4.7.2, CPU 0, one Rayon worker and
`METRUM_DEBUG=0`. Valid settings with scale 1.25 and 16/256/4,096 labels measure one warmup and nine
refresh samples, excluding setup and assertions. Every label retains font size 16. Median process
medians change from 316/5,122/87,932 µs to 120/1,749/31,565 µs. This is a UI-refresh measurement,
not simulation or whole-frame acceptance. Both styles use the same settings reader on valid data;
the before run loads the original UIStyle script, and the after run uses the corrected script.

Command: `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1 METRUM_DEBUG=0 taskset -c 0 godot --headless --path godot --script res://tests/ui_settings_test.gd -- --benchmark-ui-scale`.
Before runs add `--style-path=/tmp/metrum-full-audit/ui-settings-original-source/godot/scripts/ui/ui_style.gd`.
Release extension: `f3647c04fc3714b8f84a1f2fa506d3d93417bd47292deb4d22ee13e2b1ad605e`.
Source hashes, full commands, samples and results are in `/tmp/metrum-full-audit/ui-settings-*`.
No builds, tests or source changes overlapped accepted measurement.

---

### 5. Overlays

Overlays are rendered as shader-driven mesh layers on the terrain. They are toggled via the
View menu or keyboard shortcuts `7`, `8`, `9`, `0`, and `-`.

Current implementation detail: `terrain.gd` exposes five overlay modes through
`overlay_mode` — `0=None`, `1=Pollution`, `2=Noise`, `3=Desirability`, `4=Deposits`.

Pollution, noise and desirability refresh after each published daily settlement while open.
The renderer uses the existing snapshot day, caches successful uploads, and retries failures;
world replacement and resource editing retain explicit invalidation. Updating image pixels
reuses existing material bindings. Pixel sampling uses world-space texture centres and authored
environmental cell spacing. `environment_overlay_test.gd` covers cadence/cache lifecycle and real
RGBA image uploads across world-size changes (`AUDIT-01-F6/G4`).
Environmental intensity controls the terrain blend through the image's alpha channel, and the
texture clamps at world edges. `terrain_overlay_shader_test.gd` verifies actual rendered pixels
(`AUDIT-01-G5`). `./run.sh --test` runs this additional regression when `xvfb-run` is installed;
otherwise it explicitly reports the rendering check as skipped. It can also run from a graphical
session with `godot --path godot --rendering-method gl_compatibility --script res://tests/terrain_overlay_shader_test.gd`.
Gameplay keyboard shortcuts expose all five values through `input_manager.gd`; WorldEditor also
selects mode `4` while the coal-resource tools are active.

| Key | Overlay |
|-----|---------|
| 7   | None (default) |
| 8   | Pollution |
| 9   | Noise |

Zoning overlay is a separate mesh toggled with the Zoning tool or `View → Toggle Zoning Overlay`.
Traffic overlay is not currently implemented in the terrain renderer; do not expose it in the
menu until a real renderer path exists.

## Style Conventions (`UIStyle`)

**Script:** `scripts/ui/ui_style.gd` *(implemented)*.

`UIStyle` owns the shared color, sizing, and shell helpers used by the current HUD/menu
implementation. Most new UI code calls `UIStyle` factory methods instead of constructing
`StyleBoxFlat` inline. `scripts/ui/main_ui.gd` still contains one local toolbar button-capsule
style and should be migrated when that visual treatment is revisited.

```

**Layout maintenance rules:**
- Moving a script requires updating its `res://` path in every `.tscn` that references it
  and in every `preload(...)` call in other scripts. Do this in one dedicated pass per
  subdirectory, not incrementally across unrelated sessions.
- New scripts go into their target subdirectory immediately. Do not add new scripts back to
  the flat `scripts/` root.
- `scenes/` stays flat. Scene files are few enough that a subdirectory adds no value.

## Script Ownership Map

```
ui/ui_style.gd          Style constants, StyleBoxFlat factory methods — no simulation calls
ui/main_ui.gd           Bottom HUD/menu strip, submenu stack, unified menu-group wrapper, clock/speed panel, city status panel, HUD demand meter, road properties panel
ui/city_status_panel.gd  Compact treasury-value + agent-count panel — reads snapshot-backed SimulationNode values
ui/demand_meter.gd      Compact R/C/I demand meter — reads SimulationNode demand display values
ui/top_menu.gd          MenuBar, dispatches to InputManager or opens windows; shortcut-bearing entries render bracketed inline labels such as `Save [Ctrl+S]`
ui/building_inspector.gd  Window — building stats, calls SimulationNode.get_building_info_at()
ui/road_properties_window.gd  Window — edge class / no-build editing for SelectTool
ui/pack_manager.gd      Window — mod pack browser
core/input_manager.gd   Tool state, keyboard shortcuts, camera, Ctrl+S/L save/load
editors/world_editor.gd WorldEditor shell, tool UI, world load/save flow, camera policy owner
editors/world_editor_camera_input.gd  WorldEditor camera input wrapper and UI-capture gating
SimulationNode.get_demand_pressures  HUD-only R/C/I meter source, returns normalized -1.0..1.0 display pressures
SimulationNode.get_treasury_balance  HUD treasury source, snapshot-backed for paused-state edits
SimulationNode.get_agent_count       HUD live-agent source, snapshot-backed
```

`top_menu.gd` dispatches File/City/View/Help actions by calling `InputManager` methods or
opening windows directly. It does not own simulation state. Each scene root attaches its own
instance; `main_ui.gd` remains gameplay-only.

Camera ownership rules:

- gameplay and WorldEditor share one world-camera core in the `CameraNode` native node
- `CameraNode` owns camera snapshot/restore; the native game save/load bridge captures and applies
  its state only during save/load, with O(1) work and no per-tick camera synchronization
- shared world-camera behavior includes:
  - orbit math
  - pan math
  - zoom semantics
  - focus-on framing
  - terrain-following focus and camera clearance in gameplay and WorldEditor, identical in
    normal and debug modes when looking downward
  - debug extends pitch to look upward from beneath terrain, bypassing camera clearance only
    for that upward orbit while keeping the same terrain-following focus
- gameplay `input_manager.gd` and `editors/world_editor_camera_input.gd` are input-routing
  wrappers only; they decide when UI owns input and which scene-local camera policy applies
- both wrappers call `CameraNode.configure_world_camera()` for shared terrain setup and the
  existing native application debug flag; clearance defaults and debug parsing are not duplicated
  in GDScript, and the native camera has no input/frame callbacks
- projection and orthographic size updates have one native implementation; changing distance
  bounds updates both the orbit distance and orthographic view immediately
- zoom bounds, far clip policy, and focus padding may differ between gameplay and WorldEditor as
  explicit scene policy
- AssetEditor keeps its own separate sandbox camera controller because it is not terrain/world
  constrained and uses a different viewport layout

Camera validation (2026-09-11): targeted Rust tests and the headless
`res://tests/camera_save_load_test.gd` pass, covering shared zoom endpoints, hillside movement,
mode changes, saved underground views and immediate orthographic updates when bounds change.
The suite and a WorldEditor policy smoke test pass under both `METRUM_DEBUG=0` and `1`.
Updates remain O(1), with at most two existing heightmap samples and no new allocations.
Matched unprofiled release timing for the cleanup used `METRUM_DEBUG=0 RAYON_NUM_THREADS=24
godot --headless --path godot --script /tmp/metrum-camera-cleanup-benchmark.gd`, with the same
256 m flat-world fixture: one warmup plus 15 batches of 2,000 pan updates in each of three
processes, excluding setup. Before/after library SHA-256 prefixes: `49a1d0bf1c39` /
`8f7f61265fa8`. Normal median times were 1.952–1.980 / 2.034–2.067 µs per update; debug
times were 1.938–1.944 / 1.972–2.023 µs. Both remain about 2 µs per input update.
Local logs: `/tmp/metrum-camera-cleanup-benchmark-{before,after}-{1,2,3}.log`.

## Migration Notes

These are the concrete changes needed to move from current state to the target paradigm.
They are tracked in the roadmap under `CODE-02` scope.

1. **Add `UIStyle`** — completed. `scripts/ui/ui_style.gd` now owns the shared color,
   radius, padding constants and common `StyleBoxFlat` factory helpers.

2. **Add top menu** — completed. `scripts/ui/top_menu.gd` is instantiated from each scene
   root (`Main`, `AssetEditor`, `EconomyEditor`) and remains separate from `main_ui.gd`.
   Gameplay File/View/City/Tools/Help actions are wired, editor scenes expose reduced
   File/editor-action menus, and the City/Help windows currently use placeholder content
   where full data windows are not yet implemented.

3. **Migrate selection-driven properties to `Window`s** — completed for the Building
   Inspector (`scripts/ui/building_inspector.gd`) and Road Properties
   (`scripts/ui/road_properties_window.gd`). Both now use Godot's built-in title bar, drag
   behavior, and close button while preserving the existing selection/edit APIs underneath.

4. **Add City / Economy / Demand windows** — still pending. The top menu currently opens
   inline placeholder windows from `scripts/ui/top_menu.gd`; replace those one at a time
   with dedicated `Window`-based scripts when the live data views are implemented.

5. **Reorganise `scripts/` into subdirectories** — completed. New UI work starts from the
   `scripts/ui/` subtree and follows the current layout documented above.
