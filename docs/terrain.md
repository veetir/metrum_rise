# Terrain / World Terrain Spec

## Crown cohesion candidate — 2026-09-19

`RENDER-06`, visually accepted by the user on 2026-09-19 after in-game testing. Near tree cards now interpolate an outward
normal at each vertex relative to the crown centre. Solid foliage cores use the same
normal field; wood retains geometric normals. Independent face/card brightness variation
is replaced by its former mean (cards `1.105`, cores `1.04975`). Instance tint remains.
This first slice deliberately leaves silhouette consolidation and the atlas for a separate
visual comparison: vertex positions, triangle indices, UVs and wind weights match the
baseline catalogue exactly, as do instance and draw-batch counts.

The card shader also undoes the engine's backface normal reversal. Authored normals describe
the foliage volume, so turning a card over must not invert its lighting. This applies to
the shared understory card material as well; understory geometry and authored colours stay
unchanged. The reversal was verified in the [installed Godot source](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/a13da4feb/servers/rendering/renderer_rd/shaders/forward_clustered/scene_forward_clustered.glsl#L1264).
Restoring the previous shader in a negative-control run fails the new rendered winding test.

Correct lighting changes the average near radiance, so distant material multipliers are now
`0.72 / 0.90` (conifer/broadleaf). The existing 900 m GPU fixture measures distant/near
luminance at `0.999 / 0.994`, within the unchanged 10% tolerance. The wind regression measures
`0.4408` moved at 55 m and `0.0000` at 300 m. The headless appearance test passes, including
finite unit foliage normals, smooth lighting and uniform foliage albedo per surface across
all 24 near variants. These checks validate rendering contracts, not player preference.

Normal construction adds O(vertices) work once at catalogue startup. The fragment correction
is O(1), with no new texture lookup, vertex attribute, surface or simulation work. Matched
unprofiled E13 measurements and captures are recorded under `/tmp/metrum-crown-cohesion/`.
The user confirmed a clear improvement in the forest appearance.

The probe requires a fresh output directory. Baseline: `2c278b01`; candidate: the working
tree patch above that commit. Both use the identical release GDExtension (`590d8b2ac614d989…`),
Godot `4.7.1`, GTX 1060 3GB, and Kuopio `kuopio_324km2_10m` (`07ae5ff39f9c905e…`).
Rayon/engine worker settings are inherited defaults (`RAYON_NUM_THREADS` unset). Each E13
trial warms for four seconds and samples for eight, pairing scatter off/on at four yaws
and at 1.5x render scale. This prices the shipped default population, not a dense painted stand.

Fresh scatter GPU cost (`full - off`, p50 milliseconds):

| View | Before | Candidate | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| yaw 000 | 6.846 | 6.800 | -0.046 |
| yaw 090 | 6.353 | 6.282 | -0.071 |
| yaw 180 | 5.874 | 5.822 | -0.052 |
| yaw 270 | 5.906 | 5.877 | -0.029 |
| yaw 180, 1.5x | 5.495 | 5.544 | +0.049 |

No measurable rendering slowdown in this comparison; these small differences do not establish
a speedup. Draw calls, primitives and resident terrain patch counts match in all ten trials;
candidate vegetation-pending frames are zero. Final data: `before/gpu/results.json` and
`after/gpu-final/results.json` beneath the artifact directory. `after/gpu/` is an intermediate
normal-only experiment, not validation of the final patch. A separate 100 stems/ha synthetic
low-sun capture is a visual aid only, not a performance or biome acceptance test.
At 220 m with an 8-degree sun, that diagnostic has a broadleaf distant/near luminance
ratio of `1.161`; the calibrated 900 m daylight fixture does not establish a match at every
sun angle or density. This remains a measured lighting limitation despite the accepted overall improvement.
Single headless catalogue-build observations were `109.7 / 113.3 ms` before/after; these
are startup observations, not a statistically established timing difference.

## Local vegetation experiment (V01)

Vegetation adds cosmetic trees to loaded worlds.
This is a local proof of concept, not persistent vegetation or a simulation resource.
Rust generates deterministic 16 m candidate cells and rejects water, steep ground,
and sampled road/building footprints. The renderer reuses terrain residency and uploads
at most one patch per frame. Two opaque tree species each have three geometry levels.
Trees have no collisions. Near trees and bushes sway in a vertex-shader wind; nothing
else moves. The initial visibility limit is 4500 m.
Tree shadow casting is on by default and uses lathe crown proxies; visible instances,
bushes and rocks never cast. `set_cast_shadows` updates both resident and cached patches.

Placement is derived from the terrain surface. The terrain renderer stamps each committed
patch payload with the surface generation it was built from, and that generation advances
only for the patches an edit dirtied. Each tree patch records the generation it was built
against and regenerates when the terrain renderer commits a newer one, so a road, building,
or terrain edit clears the trees it covered without a world reload. The check is
`O(resident patches)` dictionary lookups per frame with no distance work. The replacement
patch enters the scene tree before the previous patch is freed.

Geometry levels switch at a hard distance boundary with no crossfade. A visibility fade
applies to a whole `MultiMeshInstance3D`, and one instance carries a whole terrain patch, so
a fade band made every plant in a `510 m` patch translucent together and moved the patch into
the transparent pass. Two invariants follow from the same fact: a band must exceed the patch
diagonal, and a range must exceed the patch half-diagonal. Both are a tax on the patch size,
which is why the vegetation grid is no longer the terrain grid. Trees more than about 2 km
away are narrower than three pixels at 720p and still alias.

The scatter runs on two grids. A terrain block with any part of it inside `_fine_tier_radius()`
(the longer of the near canopy and the understory) is carried as `PATCH_SUBDIVISION` squared
sub-patches of `127.5 m`; every block beyond it stays one `510 m` terrain patch. Only the near
canopy and the understory have bands narrower than a terrain patch, so only they need the fine
grid. Everything past the near band draws one distant crown mesh that distance picks per patch,
which needs no band at all. A patch key therefore carries the grid divisor it belongs to:
without it a coarse key and a fine key name the same square, and a block changing tier collides
with its own cached patch. `_key_span()` turns that divisor back into a span, so a caller
cannot measure a distance on one grid and a range on another.

`TREE_NEAR_FLOOR_M` is a quality floor, not a budget. At `800 m` a 15 m tree covers 13 pixels,
which is where the branched crown and its cards stop reading as a tree and the lathe cone can
take over unnoticed. The grid no longer sets it.

Distant crowns, bushes and rocks are each one surface of revolution built from a radius
profile, with a per-ring and per-segment radius perturbation, flat shading, end caps, and a
root flare on each trunk. The near conifer and broadleaf levels instead carry a two-level
branch skeleton: a tapering leader, sixteen or twelve four-sided primary limbs placed on a spiral,
two smaller children on each limb, and an opaque foliage tuft at every child tip. Branch count
and recursion depth are fixed, so catalogue construction stays linear in emitted vertices.
Triangles are emitted clockwise from the front, which is what Godot treats as the front face;
the lathe walks rings in increasing angle, so `_tri` reverses the order. Emitted the other way
every surface is inside out and back-face culling makes a small dome render as a hollow ring.
Per-face vertex colours carry the crown shading. A MultiMesh instance colour multiplies
that vertex colour rather than replacing it, so a per-placement tint costs no shader and
keeps the face shade: the near band applies one, derived from disjoint bits of the
appearance seed, spanning `0.94` to `1.06` in value with opposing red/blue shifts of
`±3.5%`. The mid and far levels carry no instance colours, because a tree there is a few
pixels wide and the tint averages to one across a patch.

The mesh catalogue is indexed by species, then variant, then near-to-far level. Conifer and
broadleaf have 12 variants, bush and rock 6. Variants differ in crown proportions,
widest-point height, taper, trunk dimensions and raggedness, all derived from the variant
index, and stay within their species: no variant is more than `1.3x` the height of the
smallest in its species. The 84 mesh levels share four materials: near tree and bush
bark/foliage geometry uses one wind `ShaderMaterial`, near tree and bush cards use one
scissor wind `ShaderMaterial`, distant crowns share one scissor/backlight `ShaderMaterial`,
and rocks keep the original `StandardMaterial3D`. Distant crowns remain static. Only the near
level selects a variant; the mid and far levels use variant zero and the whole species
population, so distance does not multiply draw calls. Those two levels also share one
instance per species: they draw the same transforms with a different mesh, so crossing the
mid boundary swaps a mesh on the buffer already uploaded instead of rebuilding the patch.
`TREE_MID_M` therefore selects a mesh per patch and is not a visibility band, which leaves
`TREE_NEAR_M` as the only boundary the band-width invariant applies to. A near patch has 38
MultiMesh nodes, 36 of them in the near band; a patch beyond the near band has two.

Patch upload is the cost that governs this, because a patch uploads in a single frame and a
frame at 60 fps is `16.7 ms`. What a patch costs depends on how far it is. Past the near band
it builds one distant instance per canopy species over the whole species population, with no
variant split, no tints and no understory; inside the band it builds all 38 nodes. The near
test is conservative by the patch half-diagonal, because the patch is one instance.

On a fixed headless fixture (near: 4096 placements as 512 conifer, 512 broadleaf, 2048 bush,
1024 rock; far: the 1024 canopy placements the same patch is sent without an understory;
median of eight after warmup) a near patch measures `18.0 ms` and a far patch `2.9 ms`,
against `20.5 ms` and `6.1 ms` when every patch built every level. Residency reaches 4500 m,
so most resident patches are far ones. A near patch is still over one frame and is not an
accepted cost.

Three implementation facts set those numbers, all measured rather than assumed. Node count
is close to free on the upload side: collapsing the 40 nodes back to 8 changed nothing, and
4 variants per species measured the same as 12. It is the placement work behind the nodes
that costs, which is why the fix skips levels rather than merging them. Interpreted
per-placement work is expensive: routing every placement through a nested untyped `Array`
rather than appending to a local typed one cost `3.8 ms` per patch. And a GDScript call in
that path costs more than what it usually wraps -- writing the four `_jitter` calls out
inline saved `2.6 ms` per patch, where replacing the four `hash()` calls inside them with
bit extraction saved only `0.8 ms` more. That is why the variant index and the tint read
bits of the existing seed, and why the jitters sit inline in `_instance_transform`.

The remaining near-patch cost is the placement loop. Every species rescans the whole payload
to filter by species, so a four-species patch walks its placements four times, and
`_instance_transform` builds three `Basis` values for each one. Grouping the payload by
species on the Rust side would make that scan a single pass.

Bushes and rocks come from a denser 8 m grid that Rust generates only when the renderer asks,
which it does for patches within 800 m, because that layer draws over a much shorter range
than the canopy.

The GPU budget now has a fresh capture, on the same GTX 1060 3GB the superseded 4% and 22%
figures came from. `E13` sweeps an eye-level 300 m horizon view through four compass yaws,
each with the scatter off and on. Four matched runs are recorded, one per near-crown design:
the lathe domes, the branch skeletons that replaced them, the skeletons with alpha-scissor
cards, and the current wind shader. Every scatter-off trial agrees across all four to within
`0.15 ms`, with identical draw calls and primitives, so the scatter columns are comparable.
The last two runs are on a newer GPU driver than the first two, and that control is what shows
the driver did not move the baseline.

| yaw | off | lathe | scatter | branched | scatter | cards | scatter | wind | scatter |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 000 | `4.2 ms` | `7.18 ms` | `+2.97` (41%) | `8.55 ms` | `+4.22` (49%) | `8.96 ms` | `+4.77` (53%) | `8.66 ms` | `+4.35` (50%) |
| 090 | `4.7 ms` | `6.70 ms` | `+2.04` (30%) | `8.00 ms` | `+3.35` (42%) | `8.51 ms` | `+3.85` (45%) | `8.24 ms` | `+3.57` (43%) |
| 180 | `5.0 ms` | `7.70 ms` | `+2.75` (36%) | `9.94 ms` | `+4.99` (50%) | `10.57 ms` | `+5.62` (53%) | `10.08 ms` | `+5.13` (51%) |
| 270 | `4.8 ms` | `7.77 ms` | `+2.99` (38%) | `9.84 ms` | `+5.04` (51%) | `10.48 ms` | `+5.72` (55%) | `9.88 ms` | `+5.12` (52%) |
| 180 at 1.5x | `8.3 ms` | `10.22 ms` | `+1.93` (19%) | `12.73 ms` | `+4.52` (36%) | `13.51 ms` | `+5.22` (39%) | `13.05 ms` | `+4.77` (37%) |

Three things follow. The scatter now costs about half the frame from a ground-level view,
which is more than the retired 22% figure claimed. It is not fill-bound: at 1.5x render scale
everything else nearly doubles while the scatter's own cost barely moves in any run, so it is
priced in vertices and draw calls. Geometry added to the near meshes is therefore paid for at
every resolution, and rendering smaller will not buy it back.

The two near-crown changes price differently, and the difference is the point. Branching moved
primitives from `4.34 M` to `7.01 M` at yaw 180 with draw calls unchanged, and the cost rose by
about the same ratio: paid in vertices. Adding cards moved primitives only to `7.30 M`, a 4%
rise, but added `407` draw calls, because a second surface is a second draw per near instance
and there are up to 24 canopy near instances per patch. It bought a visibly fuller crown for
`+0.6 ms`, against `+2.2 ms` for the branch skeleton underneath it. Cut-outs are the cheaper
way to add apparent foliage, which is the whole reason they exist.

Near-level triangle counts went `211` to `565` to `645` for a conifer, and `184` to `525` to
`525` for a broadleaf, the last of which is flat because shrinking the opaque tufts paid for
its cards exactly. Wind changes no count: vertex positions, normals, UVs, indices, colour RGB
and mesh bounds are all byte-identical to the cards build, and only vertex colour alpha moved.
Catalogue construction went from `31 ms` to `51 ms` to `68 ms` including one-time texture
generation, all once at startup; a matched pair across the wind change measures `64.4 ms`
against `63.4 ms`, so authoring the weights costs nothing.

The cards are three crossed quads per branch tip on a second surface of the same `ArrayMesh`,
so they share the instance transforms already uploaded and add no instances. They use a shared
`512x512` baked 2x2 atlas (256 pixels per cell), with generic broadleaf at top left,
birch at top right, and two conifer sprays on the bottom. Broadleaf cards select their
appearance's cell; conifers select the bottom column from `seed & 1`, in O(1) work per
cluster. The shader keeps alpha scissor
at `0.4`, which keeps them in the opaque pass with depth write intact. Blending
here would repeat the crossfade mistake that cost 17-28% of frame time. Their normals point
away from the crown centre rather than along the quad, because a quad lit by its own facing
reads as a flat plate rather than as foliage.

The atlas is authored by `tools/bake_foliage_atlas.py` using an orthographic Blender
CPU render. Bake with `blender --background --python tools/bake_foliage_atlas.py --
godot/assets/textures/vegetation/foliage_atlas.png`. The PNG is the reviewable base
image and has a generated `.png.import`; the material loads the accompanying RGBA8
DDS, with its generated `.dds.uid`, because PNG cannot carry authored mipmaps. The DDS
costs 1,398,100 bytes of pixel data including mips, shared by the catalogue. No shader,
surface, placement, LOD range, or sway-weight change accompanies the atlas. The birch
and crown geometry changes below have their own measured vertex budget.
RGB is white at every texel, the exact flood extension of the white opaque mask;
vertex RGB continues to supply the foliage palette.

Mip alpha is rescaled offline independently per cell against its level-0 coverage.
The closest achievable coverage is selected after 8-bit quantization; correction uses
the uncorrected box-filter pyramid, avoiding compounded rescaling. At one pixel per
cell, none of the four target coverages can be represented: the closest result is zero.
The two terminal levels therefore disappear; this is an explicit subpixel limitation,
not a claim of exact preservation at every size. At those levels atlas cells also
cannot remain isolated under bilinear filtering. GPU appearance at these transitions
remains unverified. Measured coverage above `0.4`, in percent:

| Atlas mip size | Uncorrected | Corrected |
|---|---:|---:|
| 512x512 | 19.1074 | 19.1074 |
| 256x256 | 19.5267 | 19.1238 |
| 128x128 | 20.5994 | 19.0918 |
| 64x64 | 20.9961 | 19.1162 |
| 32x32 | 21.3867 | 19.0430 |
| 16x16 | 21.4844 | 19.1406 |
| 8x8 | 20.3125 | 20.3125 |
| 4x4 | 0.0000 | 25.0000 |
| 2x2 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| 1x1 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |

The committed `foliage_atlas.coverage.json` includes the measurements for each cell.

The atlas costs fill, and the cause is not the texture. Measured against the palette build
on one binary, the scatter's own cost rose `0.12`, `0.17`, `0.43` and `0.11 ms` across the
four yaws and `0.72 ms` at `1.5x` render scale, with draw calls and primitives byte-identical
in every trial. Halving the atlas to `512` cut its pixel data from `5.33 MB` to `1.33 MB` and
`4 MB` of measured video memory with it, and changed the frame cost by less than the
scatter-off control's own drift between runs. Texture bandwidth is therefore not what this
costs, and the atlas is `512` for video memory and repository size rather than for speed.

What it costs is occlusion. The retired procedural mask passed `34.30%` of its texels above
the `0.4` threshold; the baked cells pass `15.85%` to `21.66%`, between `0.46x` and `0.63x`
as many fragments. Honest leaf and needle silhouettes are mostly holes, so the cards hide
less of what stands behind them and that geometry is drawn instead. That is a fill cost, which
is why it grows with render scale while the rest of the scatter's price does not. It is the
standing price of the silhouette, not a defect to tune away: filling the cells back in would
return the blob the atlas replaced.
The appearance regression checks that Godot retains every authored DDS byte and all
a mip chain complete to 1x1, and checks both rows and seed parities without weakening shader or sway
assertions. A separate before/after snapshot of every surface's arrays, excluding UVs,
is byte-identical, including indices, positions, normals and vertex colour alpha.

Fresh CPU validation on 2026-09-12 used base `0ff8230d` and this atlas change, Godot
4.7.1 headless with the same existing GDExtension library and default worker settings.
No GPU benchmark or windowed game was run. Five sequential fresh processes per build
timed `Species.build_meshes()` with `Time.get_ticks_usec()`, including first-use texture
and material creation but excluding script parsing. Before: 61.753, 67.198, 62.101,
68.695, 65.026 ms; after: 56.773, 56.928, 56.153, 56.124, 56.281 ms. Medians are
65.026 and 56.281 ms (13.45% lower). The appearance test's `FIXTURE` actually reports
patch upload, not catalogue construction: its maximum is 19.358 ms before and
18.565 ms after. Those single upload maxima are not a GPU or performance acceptance.

Commands were `godot --path godot --headless --log-file <writable-log> --script
res://tests/vegetation_appearance_test.gd` and the corresponding
`vegetation_invalidation_test.gd`, plus `godot --path godot --headless --log-file
<writable-log> --import`. Full output, the temporary catalogue/snapshot harnesses,
and all samples are in `/tmp/foliage-atlas-validation/`. Final appearance output:
`PASS vegetation appearance, shared material, LOD buckets, positions and empty density`;
`grep -c "SCRIPT ERROR"` is 0. Invalidation exits 0 with 0 `SCRIPT ERROR` lines; that
harness contains no PASS print. The initial default-log run crashed on a sandbox-denied
user-log write; matched runs use writable logs. Import generated the companions despite
sandbox-denied editor settings and debug socket operations.

Two Blender 5.2.1 LTS bakes (fixed seed, 32 Cycles samples, one CPU thread) produce
PNG SHA-256 `612472fef60b135ae51678b110538b12f5d4b884425773fb365142d6440a7dca`
on both runs; the DDS files also match, SHA-256
`cd8c63752bbfbf5bcef3ea74294edc0e16c600f15ef363a32bd9e709871e315e`.
Blender wrote all artifacts but its PulseAudio shutdown stalled inside the sandbox;
artifact reproducibility is verified independently of that shutdown.

Wind is a vertex displacement and nothing else. Both wind shaders declare
`world_vertex_coords` and add a world-space offset directly, which avoids an inverse model
matrix per vertex; they share one `.gdshaderinc` so the bark surface and the card surface of
the same tree can never be displaced by different functions and tear apart. The per-plant
phase comes from `MODEL_MATRIX[3].xz`, the instance origin, so no per-instance data is added:
the placement loop already documents that one instance colour array costs an upload call and
four floats per instance, and a second such array for a cosmetic effect is not worth that.
Projecting that origin onto the wind direction also makes a gust travel across the landscape
instead of every tree moving in lockstep. How much a vertex moves is authored into vertex
colour alpha at mesh build time: `0` at the root flare, `0.16` up the trunk, `0.70` at primary
limb tips, `1` at the child tips, the foliage cores and the cards, and `0` to `0.8` up a bush.
The fragment stage reads alpha as a sway weight and never as opacity; the card shader takes
its alpha from the mask alone. Neither shader disables ambient or goes unshaded, so the day
cycle still reaches vegetation through the scene's key light exactly as it did through
`StandardMaterial3D`.

The foliage palette is calibrated against the ground rather than authored by eye. The mean
linear albedo of `grass002_2k_albedo.jpg`, after the terrain shader's `0.90` strength, is
`(0.037, 0.065, 0.016)`: hue `94.4` degrees, saturation `0.756`. Foliage sat at hue `104` to
`130` degrees and saturation `0.54` to `0.58`, which is why it read blue-green against a
yellow-green ground. Conifer moved to `112` degrees, broadleaf and bush to `100`, all three
to saturation `0.66` to `0.68`, each preserving its original luminance exactly. Foliage was
never darker than the ground; at `2.0x` to `2.7x` its luminance it is brighter, and the
blackness in low sun was a shading result rather than an albedo one.

That shading is what `BACKLIGHT` fixes: foliage transmits light instead of blocking it, so a
backlit crown no longer goes black at the hour the scatter dominates the frame. Bark must not
transmit, and one material carries both, so the term is gated on the palette's green bias,
`smoothstep(0.0, 0.05, albedo.g - albedo.r)`. That is `0` for every bark and rock colour and
`1` for every foliage colour, and it costs no vertex attribute, which matters on a scatter
priced in vertices. The gate depends on the palette keeping green above red on foliage only.

The bush was the last near plant without cards, and a closed seven-sided lathe dome reads as a
boulder rather than undergrowth. It now builds like a tree: a coarser core, five segments by
four rings instead of seven by five, under four card clusters climbing the dome. Card sway
weights are `0.2`, `0.4`, `0.6` and `0.8`, each matching the core weight directly beneath it so
the two cannot tear apart, and every one of those values lands exactly on an 8-bit vertex
colour boundary, which is what makes them assertable at all.

Palette, backlight and bush cards were measured as one matched pair on the merged tree, with
an identical binary and world on both sides; the four-column table above predates that merge
and is not comparable to it. Isolating the scatter as full minus off, its cost moved `+0.06`,
`+0.01`, `+0.02` and `-0.01 ms` across the four yaws and `-0.23 ms` at `1.5x` render scale,
against a scatter-off control that itself drifted up to `0.29 ms` between the two runs. Draw
calls rose by `42` to `60`, the bush card surface, while primitives fell by `58,566` to
`83,910`: the coarser core more than paid for the clusters on top of it. Better silhouette,
fewer triangles, cost unchanged within the noise floor.

Distant crowns and rocks stay rigid on purpose. They are the overwhelming majority of
instances, a tree at `800 m` is a few pixels wide, and its sway would be below a pixel, so
displacing them would be the largest cost in the change and would buy nothing visible.

The wind run is the first change in this experiment that made the frame faster. Draw calls and
primitives are identical to the cards run in every trial, and GPU time falls by `0.27` to
`0.60 ms`, because the two lean shaders replace `StandardMaterial3D`'s general-purpose one on
every near plant. The vertex cost of three sine terms is smaller than what the uber-shader
charged for features these meshes never used. Motion is verified the same way the cost is: two
captures of the same camera at different wall-clock times are pixel-identical with the scatter
off, and differ over 6% of the frame with it on.

Anti-aliasing was measured rather than assumed, and the obvious lever lost. The project had
none of the three modes enabled. `4x` MSAA costs `1.87` to `3.14 ms` across the four yaws and
`4.88 ms` at `1.5x` render scale; `2x` costs `0.95` to `1.71 ms` and `2.60 ms`. FXAA costs
between `-0.14` and `+0.23 ms`, inside the scatter-off control's own drift. On a crop of the
mid-distance tree line, mean pixel-to-pixel difference falls from `31.01` with no filter to
`26.13` under `4x` MSAA and `20.30` under FXAA: FXAA removes more than twice the speckle for
roughly a tenth of the cost, so it is the mode the project enables.

The reason MSAA loses is that it answers the wrong question. It antialiases geometry
silhouette edges and shades once per pixel, while this noise is alpha-scissor card cut-outs,
which it cannot touch without `alpha_to_coverage`, and foliage finer than one pixel, which it
never touches. Note also that MSAA costs the scatter-off control `2.0` to `2.9 ms` on its own:
the vegetation is vertex-bound but the frame is not, and multisampling is a whole-frame price.
FXAA is a partial mitigation, not a fix. Detail below a pixel can only be resolved by
averaging it down, which geometry cannot do and a mipmapped texture can, so impostors for the
mid and far levels remain the actual answer to distance noise.

Three pop-in symptoms share one cause and are tracked as `RENDER-02`: every range is
evaluated once per patch, so half a square kilometre of vegetation switches as a unit, near
trees and all vegetation shadows arrive together at `TREE_NEAR_M`, and branched crowns are
drawn to `800 m` where their detail aliases. `TREE_NEAR_M` cannot be shortened while the LOD
unit is the patch, because a band narrower than the patch diagonal would draw distant crowns
for plants at the camera's feet. Per-plant alpha hashing, which stays in the opaque pass
unlike the removed `VISIBILITY_RANGE_FADE_SELF`, is the fix that also unpins the band.

The September birch/crown revision below addresses the exposed conifer trunk and the
monochrome palette. Its visual result and remaining patch-switch brightness need a later
GPU inspection; the historical GPU sweeps above do not validate this revision.

The same sweep run against the build before the distance gating gives draw calls identical to
the digit and GPU times inside noise. Skipping the near band on a distant patch is an upload
and memory win only: Godot was already culling those instances by their visibility range, and
a culled `MultiMeshInstance3D` issues no draw call. The gain is that the patch never builds
them, not that the GPU stops drawing them.
Canopy density is still roughly one tree per 330 m2 against about one per 10 m2 in a real
stand, and closing that gap needs a canopy representation for mid and far distance rather
than more instances.

### The forest was a CPU cost pretending to be a GPU one (2026-09-21)

The player reported that a brush-painted stand destroyed performance, that the tree grid read
as visible blocks, and asked for more LOD levels. All three have one root cause: a vegetation
patch was a terrain render patch. A `510 m` patch puts a `721 m` floor under the near band,
which is the only reason the near cards were drawn out to `800 m`.

Cutting the vegetation grid off the terrain grid removed that floor, and the near band was
then set to `200 m` on the strength of a brush-painted stand, where the band is the largest
single GPU cost. That was wrong. **A painted stand is about 531 stems/ha against the
generator's 30.47, so it is the worst case by construction, not the normal one.** Experiment
E17 swept the band at the generator's own density: `200 m` to `800 m` costs `0.94 ms` of GPU.
The short band bought nothing in normal play and made every tree past `200 m` a smooth cone at
53 pixels, which the player saw immediately. The floor is back at `800 m`, and the answer to a
painted stand is its stem count, not a band every normal view has to look at.

With the band restored, E17 showed the frame spending `27.66 ms` while the GPU spent `12.54 ms`.
The scatter had become a CPU cost. Two things caused it, both consequences of subdividing:

- The staleness sweep read two generations across the language boundary per sub-patch. Sixteen
  sub-patches share one terrain owner, so fifteen of every sixteen reads repeated an answer the
  sweep already had: 5650 calls a frame at 2518 resident patches. The sweep now caches the pair
  per owner. `_is_patch_stale` and `_upload_patch` called from anywhere else still read live
  values, because their answer is about the moment they are asked, and `_upload_patch` stamps
  what it reads, so a cached value there loses an edit.
- Subdivision applied to the whole `4500 m` scatter when only the near canopy and understory
  need it. Restricting it to `_fine_tier_radius()` took resident patches from 2518 to 415 and
  frame time from `27.66 ms` to `13.01 ms` with the GPU unchanged. The overhang between frame
  time and GPU time went from `15.1 ms` to `0.22 ms`.

### Tree shadow casting is the largest cost in a close forest view (2026-09-22)

Experiment E19 prices shadows from inside a painted stand, in the shipped configuration. The
pose runs near `86 ms`, which heats the card enough that trial order alone moves the result by
several percent, so the authored range is repeated between every measurement and the drift is
fitted out. Baselines came in at `85.33`, `86.39`, `88.25` and `88.23 ms`.

| trial | GPU p50 | fitted baseline | saving | draws | primitives |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| authored, shadow range `420 m` | `85.33` | - | - | 7316 | 106.0 M |
| trees do not cast | `48.13` | `85.86` | **`37.72`** | 3476 | 37.1 M |
| shadow range `250 m` | `77.73` | `87.32` | `9.59` | 5684 | 78.1 M |
| shadow range `150 m` | `67.88` | `88.24` | `20.35` | 4724 | 60.3 M |

**Tree shadow casting is `37.7 ms` of an `86 ms` frame, and 65 percent of every primitive in
it.** The draw and primitive counts fall monotonically with the range and corroborate each
step, which is what makes the fitted savings trustworthy at this drift.

This was a consequence of the near band and the shadow range being set independently. Trees
cast only at LOD0 in that measurement, the near band reached `800 m` and
`SHADOW_MAX_DISTANCE_M` was `420 m`, so the full `420 m` disc of branched crowns and alpha
scissored cards was re-rendered into four cascades. When the band was `200 m` that disc was
the band; once it was restored the range was what bounded it, and nothing in the vegetation
renderer knew the range existed. The section below is what replaced that caster.

A whole-scene control that disabled the sun's shadows was attempted and discarded: it reported
draw and primitive counts identical to shadows being on, so the lever did not take effect. The
trees-do-not-cast trial isolates the same quantity and did behave, so the control was dropped
rather than debugged.

### Trees cast from the lathe crown, not from the tree (2026-09-22)

The standard answer to the cost above is the one every open-world renderer uses: a tree does
not cast from the mesh it is drawn with. A shadow is a blurred patch on ground a few metres
away, so it needs a silhouette, not structure, and alpha scissored foliage is the worst
possible caster because every shadow fragment does a texture fetch and a discard.

The patch already holds the cheap caster. Its distant level is one `MultiMesh` over the same
trees as the near level, and inside the near band it is simply held out of sight. Reusing it
was not free, though: a rendered probe put a `SHADOWS_ONLY` caster inside and outside its
visibility range and counted shadowed ground pixels, and got `2538` in range against `0` out
of it, with the in-range case reproduced exactly on a repeat. **A range culled instance does
not cast**, so the caster has to be an instance of its own that is never culled.

The renderer therefore adds one `SHADOWS_ONLY` instance per tree species per patch. It shares
the distant instance's `MultiMesh` resource, so it shares its transforms and follows its
mid/far mesh swap, and its visibility range covers the whole patch life. Every visible
instance stops casting. That is two nodes per patch and no new geometry, transform copy or
buffer upload. Bush and rock still never cast, and the runtime toggle reaches the proxy in
resident and cached patches, hiding it when casting is off so an `OFF` proxy cannot draw.

E19 re-run on the same pose and the shipped configuration, against the table above:

| trial | GPU p50 before | GPU p50 after | draws | primitives |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| authored, shadow range `420 m` | `85.33` | `58.92` | 7316 → 3652 | `106.0 M` → `44.59 M` |
| trees do not cast | `48.13` | `48.24` | 3476 → 3476 | `37.1 M` → `37.04 M` |
| shadow range `250 m` | `77.73` | `58.59` | 5684 → 3568 | `78.1 M` → `41.14 M` |
| shadow range `150 m` | `67.88` | `57.81` | 4724 → 3528 | `60.3 M` → `39.36 M` |

**The shipped configuration goes from `85.33 ms` to `58.92 ms`, a `26.4 ms` saving of `31%`.**
The trees-do-not-cast trial is the control that makes the two processes comparable: it carries
no tree shadows in either build and reproduced to `0.11 ms`, `0` draws and `0.2%` of
primitives. Shadow primitives fall from `68.9 M` to `7.55 M` and shadow draw calls from `3840`
to `176`. What is left of tree shadow cost is `11.06 ms` against a fitted baseline, down from
`37.72 ms`.

The sweep also loses its point, which corroborates the diagnosis: shortening the range to
`250 m` now buys `0.9 ms` and to `150 m` buys `1.9 ms`, against `9.59` and `20.35 ms` before.
The range was expensive because the caster was expensive.

The cost is in the shape, and up close it was not acceptable. A proxy is a solid volume
standing exactly where the branched crown stands, so every foliage card is inside its own
caster and receives its shadow: close trees came out banded with hard dark streaks across
the crown, and a dense clump went dark through its lower half. The proxy's trunk is a `3.1`
to `5.0 m` stub against the real tree's full trunk, so at `SHADOW_NORMAL_BIAS 1.25` and
`SHADOW_BLUR 1.80` the stem shadow disappeared entirely and a tree cast a bare ellipse.

So the proxy is a shadow LOD, not a replacement, which is also how it is done elsewhere.
Inside `SHADOW_PROXY_M` a patch casts from the branched tree exactly as before and builds no
proxy at all; between that and the sun's own range it casts from the proxy; past the range it
casts nothing, because nothing it holds can reach a cascade. The choice is one value per
patch, rebuilt on the same sweep that already rebuilds on the near band and the understory,
and it is deliberately independent of the runtime shadow toggle so that toggle never has to
rebuild a placement.

`SHADOW_PROXY_M` at `120 m` costs `6.8 ms` of the `26.4 ms`:

| build | GPU p50 | draws | primitives | tree shadow cost |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| branched tree casts everywhere | `85.33` | 7316 | `106.0 M` | `37.72` |
| proxy casts everywhere | `58.92` | 3652 | `44.59 M` | `11.06` |
| **proxy past `120 m`** | **`65.69`** | — | `62.13 M` | `18.09` |

The trees-do-not-cast control came in at `48.13`, `48.24` and `48.00 ms` across the three
separate processes, which is what licenses comparing them. `19.6 ms` of the `26.4 ms` survives
the gate, and the two nearest of the four cascades keep the correct caster.

### The near band is the last big cost, and the grid is a free 13 ms (2026-09-22)

With the shadow proxy in, `18 ms` of the close pose is tree shadows and about `44 ms` is
vegetation drawn. E20 prices that at the E19 pose and the painted density, sweeping the band
the branched tree is drawn in and the grid it is carried on. Baselines ran at positions 1, 3,
5 and 7 and came in at `65.84`, `66.34`, `70.38` and `69.97 ms`, a `6.3%` drift that is fitted
out below.

| trial | GPU p50 | fitted baseline | saving | draws | primitives |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| near band `800 m`, subdivision 4 | `65.84` | – | – | 4708 | `62.19 M` |
| near band `400 m` | `43.74` | `66.49` | `22.75` | 3399 | `43.03 M` |
| near band `200 m` | `34.67` | `68.13` | **`33.46`** | 2839 | `33.85 M` |
| subdivision 8 | `56.05` | `69.78` | **`13.73`** | 10960 | `47.40 M` |

**The branched tree drawn from `200 m` to `800 m` costs `33.5 ms`.** E17 priced the same band
at the generator's own density at `0.94 ms`, so this is the painted stand's own cost and
nothing else. It is now larger than the shadow cost, and it is the ceiling on what a level
between the branched tree and the lathe could win.

**Subdivision 8 is worth `13.7 ms` and nothing on the CPU.** It cuts primitives by `24%` while
raising draw calls from 4708 to 10960, and the frame-to-GPU overhang stayed between `0.13` and
`0.25 ms` in every trial including that one, so the finer cull pays for its own draw calls
several times over on this GPU. The pose is static, though, and patch churn while the camera
moves is what made subdivision expensive before the two-tier grid, so this wants a moving
camera before it ships. It did not survive one; see the next section.

### The branched tree at half the wood is worth 26 ms (2026-09-22)

The canopy had two authored levels and a 9.4x step between them. A third now sits between
them, catalogue index 1, and the two lathes move to 2 and 3.

**It cuts wood and keeps every card.** Index 1 omits the depth-1 child branch tubes and the
solid foliage tufts behind the cards, and turns the trunk lathes from five sides to four.
Primary bough counts are untouched at 14, 20 and 12 for pine, spruce and broadleaf, so the
silhouette is the same one. Every card's arrays are byte-identical between the two levels
across all 24 variants, `_crown_envelope` is unchanged, and both levels use the same cached
wind and card materials. The distant coverage and radiance constants still derive from index
0 and did not move.

| form | level 0 opaque | cards | level 1 opaque | cards | total retained |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| pine | 727 | 168 | 212 | 168 | `42.5%` |
| spruce | 1005 | 240 | 276 | 240 | `41.5%` |
| birch | 821 | 144 | 340 | 144 | `50.2%` |
| aspen | 721 | 144 | 260 | 144 | `46.7%` |

**A patch picks its level the way it already picks its crown.** `TREE_NEAR_DETAIL_M` is a
mesh swap on the instance already uploaded, not a visibility band, so it needs no band wider
than a patch and adds no instance, no draw call and no second copy of the transforms: a
populated near patch still carries 38 nodes. A band would have broken the rule this file
states twice, because 45 m is far narrower than the 180 m diagonal of a 127.5 m sub-patch.
The switch is therefore per patch, and a patch changes level as a whole.

**E23 prices it.** Same painted stand and pose as E20, sweeping the handover distance. `d800`
draws the whole near band from the branched tree, which is what shipped. `d1` draws all of it
from the reduced level. Controls ran at positions 1, 3, 5 and 7 and drifted `0.33 ms` per
position, fitted out below.

| handover | GPU p50 | fitted baseline | saving | draws | primitives |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `800 m` (shipped) | `65.27` | – | – | 4708 | `62.19 M` |
| `180 m` | `46.10` | `65.70` | `19.61` | 4708 | `44.44 M` |
| `45 m` | `40.53` | `66.37` | **`25.84`** | 4708 | `34.27 M` |
| `1 m` | `41.49` | `67.03` | `25.54` | 4708 | `31.75 M` |

**Nearly all of it arrives by 45 m, and nothing arrives after.** Moving the handover from
45 m to 1 m removes another `2.5 M` primitives and buys no time at all, inside the drift
bracket. The detailed tree can therefore be kept as close as it looks best; there is no
performance argument for pushing the handover nearer than 45 m, and `180 m` still returns
three quarters of the saving if the switch proves visible.

**The saving is geometry, not fill.** Draw calls are identical in every trial and primitives
fall `45%`. E18 found the near cost follows card area rather than plane count, and that
remains true of the cards; this is the other half of the near cost, and the branch tubes were
carrying it. They are dense, thin and mostly inside the foliage, they are submitted again by
the depth pre-pass, and again by up to four shadow cascades within `SHADOW_PROXY_M`.

Headless suites: appearance, edit, invalidation and land cover all pass, each checked for
both `SCRIPT ERROR` and `ERROR:`. Startup catalogue construction goes from `113` to `148 ms`,
once, and the maximum patch upload is unchanged within noise at `19.3` to `20.2 ms`. The
handover distance is a starting point for a rendered sweep, not a tuned result: at 1080p and
the default 75 degree vertical FOV the projection is 703.7 px/rad, so a 15 m tree covers
about 235 px at 45 m and about 1056 px at 10 m.

### The finer grid does not survive a moving camera (2026-09-22)

E21 pans the E20 pose `800 m` in `20 seconds`, through the middle of the `1600 m` painted
square so the whole traversal stays inside the stand. E22 repeats the pan and caps the
per-frame upload budget instead of deriving it from the subdivision. Both ran against the
release library, which is the build the CPU side has to be judged on.

**The GPU saving is real and it reproduces while moving.** Subdivision 8 came in `10.40 ms`
below subdivision 4 back to back at the standing pose, and `10.33` and `10.04 ms` below the
fitted baseline across the two panning trials.

**The frame does not follow the GPU.** The quantity that decides this is the frame time minus
the GPU time at the same percentile: it is what the CPU adds after the GPU has finished.

| trial | grid | budget | GPU p99 | frame p99 | overhang | frame p999 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| E21 pan a | 4 | 16 | `68.65` | `70.19` | `1.54` | `75.24` |
| E21 pan b | 4 | 16 | `72.14` | `72.76` | `0.62` | `74.20` |
| E21 pan c | 4 | 16 | `70.56` | `71.16` | `0.60` | `75.43` |
| E21 pan | 8 | 64 | `66.85` | `75.14` | **`8.29`** | `89.33` |
| E21 pan | 8 | 64 | `66.74` | `77.01` | **`10.27`** | `87.79` |
| E22 pan a | 4 | 16 | `69.50` | `70.12` | `0.62` | `70.55` |
| E22 pan b | 4 | 16 | `70.99` | `71.38` | `0.39` | `72.28` |
| E22 pan c | 4 | 16 | `68.03` | `69.05` | `1.02` | `70.60` |
| E22 pan | 8 | 64 | `63.78` | `84.80` | **`21.02`** | `90.95` |
| E22 pan | 8 | 16 | `61.26` | `88.08` | **`26.82`** | `95.19` |
| E22 pan | 8 | 8 | `65.96` | `70.67` | **`4.71`** | `91.81` |

Six subdivision 4 trials hold the overhang at or below `1.54 ms`. Five subdivision 8 trials
put it between `4.71` and `26.82 ms`. The tail figure itself is noisy from run to run, and the
direction is not: the finer grid buys `10 ms` of GPU median and hands back more than that in
CPU spikes, which is a stutter rather than a throughput gain.

**The per-frame upload budget is not the cause.** The budget is the subdivision squared, so a
finer grid also lets one frame build four times as many sub-patches, which was the obvious
suspect. Capping it at 16 made the tail worse, not better, and raised the frames carrying
vegetation work from 10 to 46. Capping it at 8 pulled p99 back to `70.67 ms` but left p999 at
`91.81` and 116 frames carrying work. The spike is somewhere else.

**The residency sweep is what scales.** The sweep rebuilds `wanted` from every resident
terrain block by expanding each into the sub-patches it owns, which is the subdivision squared
per block, then retires, restores and sorts against that set. It runs when the camera changes
cell, which during a pan is often. Resident vegetation patches went from 483 to 1347 between
the two grids. The steady per-frame scan under `if queue.is_empty()` is not the problem: at the
median the frame tracks the GPU within `0.4 ms` at both subdivisions.

**Subdivision 8 is therefore not taken.** `PATCH_SUBDIVISION` stays at 4. Taking the `10 ms`
needs the sweep made incremental, so that crossing a cell costs the difference between two
residency sets instead of a fresh construction of the whole one. That is real work and it is
not a constant change.

### A tree keeps its form across the patch grids (2026-09-25)

A terrain patch is drawn as sixteen `127.5 m` vegetation patches inside the fine radius and as
one `510 m` patch past it. Rust packed each plant relative to the patch it was fetched for, and
the renderer keyed the cosmetic seed of a plant on that position: variant, tint, height, width
and lean. The same plant therefore had one form in the fine patch and another in the coarse one,
and every tree of a terrain patch changed form at once when the patch crossed the fine radius,
about `420 m` out. In play that reads as a block of trees switching to similar trees.

`get_decorative_tree_patch` now packs world positions, and the renderer subtracts the patch
origin for the transform. The seed and the density subset read the world position, which is the
same bits in both grids. A same-pose probe renders one pose with the vegetation state of the
previous pose and with its own, wind frozen, along a `320 m` sideways flight at `150 m` over
the Kuopio forest in `8 m` steps. The two grid changes on that path changed `9405` and `670`
pixels before and `5` and `7` after. What still changes on that path: the per-patch shadow
caster switch at `SHADOW_PROXY_M` (up to `668` pixels in one step), and the understory, which is
built only in near-band patches and so ends at the near-band patch edge (`100-200` pixels of
rocks and bushes per step), short of its own `420 m` range.

### Each tree hands over to its impostor on its own distance (2026-09-24)

Every level decision was made per patch. Godot measures a visibility range once per
`MultiMeshInstance3D`, and a patch is `127.5 m` across, so at the switch every tree in a patch
changed at once. A per-patch jitter only moved the staircase around. The handover now happens
per tree, in the shaders, and the patch ranges only bound which patches take part.

- Each tree's impostor share is `smoothstep(150 m, 200 m)` of its origin's distance to the main
  camera (`TREE_CROSSFADE_END_M`, `TREE_CROSSFADE_M`). The branched cards keep the screen pixels
  whose interleaved-gradient threshold is at or above the share, and the impostor keeps the
  rest, so the two cover each pixel once. Screen space is the only space both surfaces share.
- A representation whose share is spent collapses to a point in the vertex stage, so it is not
  rasterised. Wood takes no dither: a discard would move every trunk off the opaque fast path.
  It collapses at the middle of its tree's handover.
- Shadows hand over whole at `200 m`, per tree: the branched tree casts until then and the proxy
  casts after. Dithering the shadow as well drew every proxy from `60 m` and cost `2.1 ms` in the
  stand. `cast_every_tree` keeps the proxy casting for every tree behind cheap casters.
- Understory shares the tree materials and keeps its own ranges; `hands_over` gates the handover
  to canopy instances.
- Wind fades out over the `50 m` before the handover begins, because the impostor does not sway.
- A patch draws its branched level to `canopy_near_m()` plus the farthest tree origin from the
  centre of its shared bounds, and its impostor from the handover start less the same margin.
  `canopy_near_m()` no longer needs to clear the patch diagonal, so the grid floor is gone.

E24, GTX 1060, same method as above:

| pose | per-patch switch | per-tree handover | primitives |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| in the stand, crown height | `23.7-23.8 ms` | `26.3-26.7 ms` | `22.03 M` → `24.40 M` |
| aerial, 350 m up | `20.1-20.2 ms` | `20.3-20.5 ms` | `7.22 M` → `7.21 M` |

The cost in the stand is the overlap: a patch holds both levels while any of its trees is in the
band, which is the band plus the patch reach. Stills of the dense stand from altitude and from
crown height show no patch-shaped block. Moving-camera dither shimmer is not measured.

### One impostor per near variant (2026-09-24)

Four baked forms (pine, spruce, birch, aspen) stood in for 24 near variants. A tree therefore
became another tree at the switch: in play, a tall sparse pine drew as a dense bushy pine with
orange bark in its crown at distance, and turned dark and sparse as the camera closed in. A
paired render of one view with every tree branched and with every tree an impostor showed the
two as different trees. The bake now makes one form per variant, from the reduced tree, which
is the level the impostor replaces at the switch. The texture-array layer is the variant, and
the custom data carries the near instance tint, which the impostor multiplies its albedo by.
Frames drop from `128` to `64` px, so 24 forms take `65 MB` against `45 MB` for the four forms.
A 15 m tree covers about 42 px at the `250 m` switch. The level-match test now compares against
the reduced tree. `VOLUME_LIFT_GAIN` drops from `3.0` to `2.0` and `IMPOSTOR_RADIANCE_MATCH` is
`0.98 / 0.973`, which holds `0.882-1.120` and `0.896-1.112` over the 36 poses.

E24: `23.7-23.8 ms` in the stand, unchanged. From the air the frame costs `20.1-20.2 ms`, up from
`16.1-16.2 ms`, with `1.33 M` more primitives and 31 more draws. The textures add no primitives:
this is the proxy that near-caster patches now build, casting for branched trees that are
range-culled from `350 m` up. Those patches cast no shadows at all before that fix.

### Trees stop receiving the shadows of the proxies they stand in (2026-09-23)

In play the impostor build showed a bright or dark block of forest near the camera, and blocks
that changed brightness as the camera moved. Two causes were found, and both were measured on a
low aerial view over the painted stand (140 m up, 35 degrees down, 07:30), as the mean colour
on each side of the `250 m` switch.

**The proxy shadowed whatever stood inside it.** Past `SHADOW_PROXY_M` a patch casts from the
lathe proxy, a solid volume where the crown stands. The near cards of a `120-250 m` patch and
the whole quad of every impostor are drawn inside that volume, so they received its shadow.
A patch that changed caster changed brightness, and the distant forest read darker than the
near one. The tree shaders now use a custom `light()` that restates the engine's Lambert,
backlight and roughness-one GGX terms, and fades the directional shadow out over
`TREE_SHADOW_BEGIN_M` to `TREE_SHADOW_END_M` (`90-120 m`). `SHADOW_PROXY_M` reads the end of that
fade, so every fragment that still receives a shadow sits in a patch that casts from its own
trees. The ground still receives the proxies. The canopy shade term now fades in over the same
`90-120 m` instead of at the cascade edge. With the fade off, the custom light matches the
built-in light to `0.001` luminance on both sides of the switch.

**The impostor was specular-free.** The near cards reflect the sky and the impostor did not,
so the impostor forest read warmer. It now keeps roughness one, as the cards do, and takes the
wrap through a varying. It takes no direct sun highlight: against a low sun ahead, the grazing
Fresnel term on its lifted normals rendered it up to `1.47x` the near level. The 36-pose test
then holds `0.893-1.118` for conifer and `0.884-1.112` for broadleaf, with
`IMPOSTOR_RADIANCE_MATCH` refitted to `0.99 / 0.973`.

| near / impostor at the switch | near | impostor |
|---|---|---|
| `3e761ca2` | `0.289` | `0.252` |
| shadow fade, sky reflection, no sun highlight | `0.326` | `0.299` |

**The reduced tree kept four trunk sides.** A probe renders each camera pose twice, once with
the vegetation state of that pose and once with the state of the next pose, with the wind
frozen. Every difference is a switch the renderer made, and nothing else. On a low pan through
a sparse stand (35 m up, 30 steps of 4 m), the patch under the camera crossed
`TREE_NEAR_DETAIL_M` and changed `11,687` pixels by more than `0.03` luminance. Half of that was
the fifth trunk side, which reshaded every trunk in the patch. The reduced tree now keeps five
sides, and the swap changes `5,460` pixels, which are thin child branches. Two alternatives were
priced and rejected on E24. Collapsing the extra wood per tree in the vertex shader cost
`38.7-40.5 ms` in the stand, because the collapsed vertices are still shaded. A hybrid that
kept full detail while any patch corner was within `45 m` cost `29.3-29.5 ms`. The other
switches on that pan fell from `2,338`, `2,607` and `6,706` pixels to `98`, `988` and `834`.

**A near-caster patch dropped its shadows short of the camera (2026-09-24).** A patch whose
nearest corner is inside `SHADOW_PROXY_M` casts from its branched trees and built no proxy.
That reaches patch centres near `210 m`, but Godot range-culls the branched trees at the
jittered switch, measured in 3D from the shared bounds, and a range-culled instance casts
nothing. The patch then showed impostors with no shadows until the camera closed in, and every
shadow in it appeared at once. The proxy is now built for near-caster patches too, with the
visibility range `(switch_m, far)` on the same shared bounds, so exactly one of the two casts.

E24 on the fixes: `23.8-24.1 ms` in the stand and `16.1-16.2 ms` from the air, against
`23.6 ms` and `16.5 ms` at `3e761ca2`. A motion measurement of shadow flicker is not in this
entry: at this texture density a `0.1 m` step already moves about a pixel, so frame differences
do not separate shadow change from motion.

### Distant trees are impostors of the near tree (2026-09-22)

The lathe fix in the next section matched the distant level's brightness, and a capture from
altitude (`imgs/reference/game/22-09-lod-mush.png`) still showed the switch as a line: textured
crowns on one side and a flat grey-green blanket on the other. A smooth lathe carries no
structure at the scale of one tree, so the step was in detail, not in colour. The visible
distant level is now a hemi-octahedral impostor: one camera-facing quad per tree, drawn from
a baked picture of the full near tree. The lathe stays only as the shadow caster.

**The bake is offline and on the CPU.** `tools/bake_tree_impostors.py` rasterises level 0 of
four source forms (pine, spruce, birch, aspen) from the headless catalogue export, over an
8 x 8 grid of views across the upper hemisphere at 128 px per view, 4 x 4 supersampled. It
writes albedo and object-space normals as RGBA8 DDS with full mips, and
`tree_impostors.json` records the bounds, the per-mip coverage and a SHA-256 of the source
meshes. `vegetation_appearance_test` fails when the catalogue no longer matches that hash,
so a change to `tree_species.gd` must be re-baked. Two runs are byte-identical.

Three details in the mips decide how the impostor looks at distance:

- Alpha coverage is corrected per view and per level, as in the foliage atlas, so a sparse
  crown does not thin out with distance.
- Colour and normal mips are weighted by coverage. An unweighted mean mixed the "up" normal
  that fills empty texels into every crown edge, and the distant impostors brightened with
  sun elevation.
- The normal mips are stored unnormalised. The length records how far the normals under one
  texel disagree. The shader lifts scattered texels toward up and wraps their diffuse, with
  specular off. This is the same volume response the lathe needed. Without it a distant
  crown lights by the one normal that faces the camera, which is a closed shell again.

**The runtime.** `vegetation_impostor.gdshader` blends the three nearest views by their
barycentric weights and reprojects the quad onto each view, so a tree does not jump as the
camera turns. Each species has one `Texture2DArray` per channel, and the form is a per-instance
layer in MultiMesh custom data. The distant placement loop computes the variant with
`_variant_index`, so a brush pin keeps its species at every distance. The distant buffer is
built as one packed array. The shadow proxy uses the same array as its own MultiMesh, with no
copy. Catalogue index 3 and the `TREE_MID_M` swap are removed.

**The switch moves from 800 m to 250 m.** A 15 m tree covers about 42 px at 250 m (1080p, 75
degree FOV), which a smooth cone could not stand in for and a picture of the tree can.
Lowering the floor below the coarse patch diagonal exposed a latent fault: `canopy_near_m`
read `patch_span_m`, which each upload sets to its own key's span. The band then flipped
between 250 m and 721 m with every upload, patches near the switch disagreed with their own
record on the next frame, and the forest rebuilt itself without end at about 3 frames per
second. The band now reads the fine grid span from `terrain_span_m`, and the appearance test
asserts that an upload does not move it. The assertion fails with the old accessor.

**Brightness over 36 poses.** `vegetation_level_match_test` now compares the near level with
the impostor. A grid over lift gain, wrap gain and specular picked lift 3.0, wrap 1.5 and no
specular for both species. `IMPOSTOR_RADIANCE_MATCH` is `1.0 / 0.97`. The ratio is
`0.895-1.117` for conifer and `0.893-1.119` for broadleaf, within the `0.12` tolerance.

**E24 prices it.** The painted 1.6 km stand at subdivision 4, each build at its shipped band,
three interleaved trials per pose, release library `d9ca4c5b`, GTX 1060 3GB. The baseline is
`eaa222e1` in a separate worktree, with a byte-identical probe.

| pose | lathe GPU p50 | impostor GPU p50 | draws | primitives |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| in the stand, crown height | `40.00-40.31` | `23.59-23.61` | 4708 → 3569 | `34.27 M` → `22.01 M` |
| aerial, 350 m up, 35 degrees down | `52.00-52.80` | `16.45-16.49` | 4462 → 2048 | `31.93 M` → `5.92 M` |

The frame follows the GPU within about 0.2 ms at p50 in every trial. Video memory rises by
about `43 MB`, which is the eight atlases. The maximum patch upload on the headless fixture
went from `19.9` to `20.8-23.1 ms`, about one millisecond, inside run-to-run noise.

### The distant crown was fitted at one sun (2026-09-22)

A capture from altitude (`imgs/reference/game/22-09-lod-lighting-maybe.png`) shows the forest
past the canopy switch much darker than the forest inside it. The distant level was lit, and
it matched the near level at the one pose `vegetation_level_match_test` checked, with the sun
behind the camera. A rendered sweep over camera elevation (20, 35, 55 and 80 degrees), sun
elevation (15, 35 and 60 degrees) and sun azimuth relative to the view (behind the camera, to
the side, in front of it) measured the distant/near luminance ratio at `0.49` to `1.15` for
conifer and `0.60` to `1.23` for broadleaf. The low end is always the sun in front of the
camera.

**The near crown hardly responds to where the sun is, and the lathe does.** At a 35 degree
camera and sun, moving the sun from behind the camera to in front of it takes the near conifer
from `0.243` to `0.213` luminance and the distant conifer from `0.256` to `0.114`. The near
crown is seen through: its gaps show cards on the far side of the crown, whose volume normals
face every way. The lathe is a closed shell and shows only the half that faces the camera, so a
camera that looks toward the sun sees the unlit half. One `DISTANT_RADIANCE_MATCH` cannot fix
a ratio that changes by a factor of two with the view.

**The distant shader now lights the crown as a volume.** It tilts the shell normals toward
world up by `CROWN_NORMAL_LIFT` (`0.8`), which removes most of the dependence on the sun's
azimuth. It turns specular off: with specular on and the normal fully lifted, a low sun in front of a
low camera rendered the lathe at `1.33x` the near crown and a low sun behind it at `0.82x`. It uses `diffuse_lambert_wrap` with a per-species wrap,
`DISTANT_CROWN_WRAP`, to match the near crown's response to sun elevation, which is flatter for
a conifer than for a broadleaf. A grid of lift `0.5` to `1.0` and wrap `0` to `1` over the 36
poses picked the pair with the least worst-case error: lift `0.8` for both species, wrap `0.75`
for conifer and `0.25` for broadleaf. `DISTANT_RADIANCE_MATCH` was then refitted to centre the
ratio, from `0.72 / 0.90` to `0.97 / 0.89`.

| species | ratio before | ratio after | largest distance from 1 after |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| conifer | `0.49` to `1.15` | `0.897` to `1.095` | `0.103` |
| broadleaf | `0.60` to `1.23` | `0.919` to `1.098` | `0.098` |

**The regression now checks every pose.** `vegetation_level_match_test` runs the 36 poses for
both species at `384 px` and holds each ratio within `0.12` of one. The single-pose version
passed the shipped shader while the back-lit ratio was `0.49`. The shader change adds one
matrix column, one mix and one normalize per distant fragment and removes the specular term.
It adds no vertex attribute, texture fetch, surface or draw. The mesh is unchanged.

**Superseded the same day.** The lathe is no longer drawn: the section above replaces it with
impostors and keeps it only as the shadow caster, so these constants were removed with it.

### Card area is the near cost, and plane count is not (2026-09-21)

Seen from a distance a dense stand is cheap; flown into, the same stand pins the GPU. The near
canopy's foliage cards are where that goes, so two reductions were measured against each other
in experiment E18, from inside a painted stand.

**Cropping the card quads to their own alpha bounds works.** Each atlas cell is 43 to 50 percent
opaque at the `0.4` scissor threshold, and 12 to 24 percent of each cell is margin no pixel
survives. Cropping the quad and its UVs by one affine map took GPU p50 from `31.35 ms` to
`30.51 ms`, bracketed by a repeated first trial at `31.91 ms`, with no visible change and a
level-match ratio that improved to `1.013` and `0.999`.

**Dropping the third of the three crossed planes does not work, and the reason is the useful
part.** Gating that plane out by screen size left GPU p50 at `29.99 ms` against `29.87 ms` for
cropping alone, inside the drift bracket, and `primitives` was byte-identical across trials
because collapsing a triangle to a point still submits it. The gate was also mistuned: measured
against the built tuft radii it removed the plane beyond `3.7 m` to `12.4 m`, so in practice it
was an unconditional removal wearing a threshold. It was not taken.

The reason it saved nothing is that `rendering/driver/depth_prepass/enable` is on, and these
cards are alpha scissored into the opaque pass. Early-Z already rejects the planes stacked
behind one another, so removing a plane that was mostly hidden removes work the GPU was not
doing. **The cards cost what they cover, not how many of them there are, and they pay it twice,
once in the prepass and once in the colour pass.** Reductions that shrink covered area keep
paying; reductions that only lower plane count do not.

### The crowns lost half their ground cover at the LOD switch (2026-09-13)

The player reported that distant forest reads lighter than near forest, and that a stand gains
weight with each click the camera moves in. Top-down, one zoom click changed a closed canopy
into scattered trees on bright grass.

Darkening the ground is not the answer and was already rejected with measurements; see "The
forest floor was shade baked into albedo, and it had to go". The crowns had to do the work,
and they were not there to do it.

**The distant crown was built at half the near crown's width.** `_branched_tree` treats its
`width` as a base: a branch reaches `width * _crown_reach(t) * [0.90, 1.08]`, and foliage cards
hang past each branch tip. `_conifer` and `_broadleaf` took the same `lerpf` expression and used
it as the lathe radius directly, so the distant crown was built at the branch base while the
near crown ended roughly twice as far out.

| | near crown | mid | far |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| conifer crown width | `9.68 m` | `4.70 m` | `4.68 m` |
| broadleaf crown width | `9.18 m` | `5.78 m` | `7.29 m` |

**The instrument could not see it.** `coverage` is covered pixels over the crown's own bounding
box, and `raster()` scales every level to one apparent height. Both of a crown's size terms are
divided out, so two levels can agree on coverage while one hides half the ground the other does.
The four transitions recorded at `47b51f64` as `+0.76`, `-4.76`, `+1.58` and `-1.85` percentage
points were all measured through that blind spot. They were correct and they were not evidence
of what the player was looking at.

`footprint` is now recorded beside `coverage`: the metre box a crown fills, at true relative
scale, so it is comparable across levels. `coverage` says how solid a crown is, `footprint` how
much sky it takes. Both are in `summary.csv` and `sweep.csv`, and `transitions.csv` reports
footprint against the NEAR crown rather than against the previous level, because two small steps
that agree with each other still open the ground up if both sit below it.

| footprint, against the near crown | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| conifer near to mid | `52.8%` | `101.7%` |
| conifer mid to far | `47.1%` | `93.0%` |
| broadleaf near to mid | `47.2%` | `103.9%` |
| broadleaf mid to far | `57.6%` | `88.4%` |

**The distant crown is now measured from the near one.** `_crown_envelope` returns the mean
foliage extent of a near mesh as radius, top and base, averaged over all twelve variants, and
the distant lathe is built to it. This is the same method the distant crown colour already uses,
and it keeps the two in step when the near crown changes. Four things followed:

- The extent is axis-aligned, not radial. A lathe ring puts vertices on both axes, so its radius
  becomes the half width of its box; a radial reach is up to `sqrt(2)` larger and oversized the
  hull by 10 to 16 percent when it was used.
- The base matters as much as the top. An authored `crown_base` hung the distant conifer 3.5 m
  below where a pine carries its foliage, which measured `130%` of the near footprint once the
  width was right.
- The per-variant radius and height spread is gone. The scatter draws variant zero's distant
  mesh for the whole species, so a spread produced no variety and only moved that one crown off
  the envelope, by up to 8 percent in each direction.
- The birch narrowing on the mid level is gone. The envelope already contains it, because eight
  of the twelve near variants are birch. Narrowing again also split the two distant levels,
  which stand for the same mixed stand: mid measured `91%` of the near crown and far `111%`.

Two smaller corrections finished the broadleaf. Its `widest` ring is snapped to a ring the
profile actually samples: the far level has three rings at `t = 0, 1/3, 2/3, 1`, an authored
`0.38-0.49` fell between two of them, and the widest point of the crown was never built. And
`DISTANT_COVERAGE` for broadleaf moved from `0.70` to `0.82`, because a near broadleaf carries
cards that stand out of the crown in depth as well as across it and a surface of revolution has
no depth to spare: its projected extent is already its width.

**Cost.** No triangle was added anywhere, at any level, for either species: the per-variant
counts are identical before and after, and the appearance test still pins them exactly at 28 and
32. Distant vertex counts moved only where two end caps stopped sharing vertices, and the
per-species maximum is unchanged at 77 and 92. The per-variant vertex array in the appearance
test was replaced by a per-species ceiling, which is tighter than what it replaced: it held 81
for conifer against a measured 77. That array pinned which variants happened to share vertices
between their caps, which is not what a distant mesh costs. No instance, draw call, material,
LOD range or atlas changed.

`vegetation_appearance_test`, `vegetation_edit_test`, `vegetation_invalidation_test` and
`vegetation_land_cover_test` each exit `0` with no `SCRIPT ERROR` and no `push_error`.
`tools/test_vegetation_lod_measure.py` runs 3 tests OK.

**Measured on the GPU, and it is free.** Two `E13` captures of `local_gpu_probe.gd` on a
GTX 1060 3GB at `1280x720`, Kuopio `kuopio_324km2_10m`, one binary (`af04b1ed`) and one world
for both, differing only in `tree_species.gd`. `E13` pairs vegetation off against full at four
yaws inside one process, so the scatter's own cost is the difference between a pair and thermal
drift cannot be read as a result. Resident patch counts and prewarm queues matched exactly,
trial for trial, across the two runs.

| scatter GPU cost, `full` minus `off`, p50 | before | after | change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| yaw 000 | `6.840 ms` | `6.927 ms` | `+0.087` |
| yaw 090 | `5.759 ms` | `5.983 ms` | `+0.224` |
| yaw 180 | `6.017 ms` | `5.969 ms` | `-0.048` |
| yaw 270 | `5.785 ms` | `5.753 ms` | `-0.032` |
| yaw 180 at 1.5x render scale | `5.923 ms` | `5.825 ms` | `-0.098` |

Three of the five decreased, the mean change is `+0.027 ms` against a `5.8-6.9 ms` scatter, and
the spread between `p50` and `p95` inside a single trial is about `0.25 ms`. The change is below
the noise floor. The `1.5x` render scale trial is the one that matters most, because wider crowns
add shaded pixels and that trial is the fill-bound case; it went down.

Two views gained `0.131%` and `0.015%` primitives and exactly one draw call each; the other three
gained neither. That is one more patch surviving frustum culling, because a wider crown gives its
`MultiMeshInstance3D` a larger bounding box. Video memory is identical to `0.1 MB` in every trial.

**Measured on screen.** In the same captures, against the `off` trial as a control, whose pixels
are identical between the two builds:

| distant ridge, yaw 000 | bare ground | with forest | darkening |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| before | `151.45` | `134.59` | `16.87` |
| after | `151.45` | `127.56` | `23.90` |

The distant canopy darkens the ground it stands on by `42%` more than it did, which is the
symptom the player reported. The same comparison at yaw 090 moves `18.65` to `20.00`.

Still open: `land_cover.rs` sizes the forest-floor disc from `CROWN_RADII_M = [3.0, 3.5]`, which
was matched to the narrow distant crown rather than to the near one it is supposed to shade.

### Dense deliberate planting — VEG-05 (2026-09-13)

The brush now fills a world-aligned **4 m lattice (625 points/ha)** with deterministic
jitter of at most **0.2 m per axis**, independent of the saved canopy spacing and stand
acceptance. The generator's candidate remains an additional point for the existing
restore contract. At the shipped 16 m canopy spacing this adds up to 39 points/ha,
so unobstructed planting approaches 664 plants/ha including those extra positions.
Existing generated plants stay in place. Water, steep ground and built surfaces still
reject every authored point through `placement_clear`; the generator and its constants
are unchanged.

Fine lattice indices never enter the edit store: each world position is mapped through
`cell_at` using the canopy spacing. Only the generator-candidate pass can lift a tombstone,
and only for the generated species. Repainting an individual cleared generated tree as
its original species still prunes the edit; a dense disc also authors the extra lattice
plants, so it intentionally retains those additions. Painting another species leaves
the tombstone in place. Exact-position checks make overlapping stamps idempotent.

Plant stamps reject radii above **256 m** before planning. The tool clamps the planting
radius and preview to that limit, including when switching from removal; removal retains
its 1024 m limit. A stamp plans at most **129² + 65² = 20,866 slots** at the supported
8 m minimum canopy spacing (17,730 at the shipped 16 m spacing), before disc and footprint
rejection. This bounds both work and transient plan storage without cutting holes in a
large requested disc. Larger areas require multiple deliberate stamps.

The two streams use indexed Rayon planning and a serialized commit, with no allocation
inside a candidate body and no new spatial index. For K candidate slots, A authored plants
in the owning cell and H local surface hits, planning costs O(K × (A + log N + H));
commit costs expected O(K). Remote vegetation edits are never scanned. Persistent vectors
allocate only when committing additions, as before.

Fresh verification on this change:

- `cd rust && cargo test --lib vegetation`: 27 passed, 0 failed, 2 ignored, exit 0.
- `cd rust && cargo test`: 1688 passed, 0 failed, 12 ignored; doc-tests 0 passed,
  0 failed; exit 0. The known intermittent road failure did not occur in this run.
- `cd rust && cargo doc --no-deps 2>&1 | grep "warning\[missing_docs\]" | wc -l`:
  output `0`; cargo doc itself exited 0 (grep exits 1 because there are no matches).
- `cd rust && cargo build`: exit 0. The resulting debug library was copied to
  `godot/bin/libmetrum_rise.so` after replacing the shared-checkout symlink with a real file.
- An additional release-profile vegetation run: 27 passed, 0 failed, 2 ignored.

All four bridge commands ran from this worktree's `godot/` directory as
`godot --headless --script res://tests/<name>.gd`, using Godot 4.7.1:

| Script | Exit | SCRIPT ERROR lines | push_error lines | PASS lines |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `vegetation_edit_test` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| `vegetation_appearance_test` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| `vegetation_invalidation_test` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 (by design) |
| `vegetation_land_cover_test` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

The tests cover fine-grid density inside existing forest, canopy-cell storage and removal,
1/4-worker determinism, independent spacing, the stamp limit, flooded footprints, save/load,
and both unchanged species-aware tombstone regressions. Headless checks do not establish
on-screen appearance or GPU cost.

Matched unprofiled release stroke measurements use the existing flat vegetation fixture,
default generator and seed, a 64 m radius at the origin, species 0, and four Rayon workers.
Setup and disc removal occur outside the measured interval; each measured call includes
planning and serialized commit. Criterion uses 20 samples, 1 s warmup and 3 s measurement.
Hardware: Intel i5-3350P, four cores; Rust 1.93.1. Baseline is `9415b2e8` plus only the
benchmark harness; changed API SHA-256 is
`49bbadf6f6964d888a375e32de3d1c258a589bff0a5c28cba4e008927f0b09d8`.

| Build | Plants added per stamp | Wall time estimate | Criterion interval |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Before | 50 | 112.24 us | 99.797–131.98 us |
| VEG-05, idle rerun | 862 | 709.83 us | 654.14–797.39 us |

The stroke adds 17.24 times as many plants at 6.32 times the wall time. A preliminary
changed-build run overlapped compilation and measured 1.9277 ms; it is not the acceptance
measurement. Neither accepted timing overlapped this task's compilation or Godot runs.
These CPU timings do not establish the cost of rendering dense vegetation across a world.

From the worktree root, the matched benchmark command is:

```bash
CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=0 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4 cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --release vegetation_brush_benchmark -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The standard Rust verification set used `CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0`,
`CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=0`, `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2` and
`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4`, retaining the test profile's optimization and assertions. Temporary
files and Godot data/cache/config paths were directed into the worktree's `validation/`.
Those runs happened in a delegated worktree that has since been removed, so their raw logs
and Criterion artifacts are not retained; the figures above are what the run reported. The
merge was verified again on `dev`, and those results are recorded below.

### The paint brush regrew the forest it was painting over (2026-09-13)

Clearing an area and then brushing `+ Rock` over the same ground put the trees back. The bush
brush did the same. Painting the untouched ground next to it worked.

`paint_at` addressed a cleared cell by its removal tombstone, and treated clearing that
tombstone as the whole edit:

```rust
if restore { core.vegetation_edits.set_removed(cell, false); }
else       { core.vegetation_edits.add(cell, plant); }
```

The `restore` branch never reads `plant`, so the species the player selected was discarded on
every cell the player had previously cleared. Clearing a tombstone does not plant anything: it
lets the generator's own candidate grow back, and the generator only ever places conifer or
broadleaf on the canopy grid. The brush therefore regrew the exact stand the player had just
removed, and only over the ground they had removed it from, which is why brushing clean ground
behaved correctly.

The brush now plants the species it was given. The tombstone is cleared only when the
generated species and the painted species already agree; the restored plant is then byte
identical to an authored one, so this stays a storage saving with no observable difference.
For every other species the tombstone stays and the painted species is authored over it. A
cell whose generated candidate a later surface edit has hidden takes that same path, so the
brush fills it instead of counting a restore that puts nothing on the ground.

The test that covered this asserted the defect. `vegetation_repaint_restores_generated_tree_and_prunes_tombstone`
painted species `3`, a rock, and required the generated tree to come back and the edit store to
empty. It passed because the helper it drew its species from returned a hardcoded `0` rather
than the species the generator picked, so the assertion could not see which species had grown.
`first_candidate` now reports the generated species, and a second test paints a rock over a
cleared tree and checks that one rock stands there and no tree does.

`cargo test` is 1685 pass, 0 fail. The four Godot vegetation scripts exit `0` with no
`SCRIPT ERROR`. `road_preview_stream_test` fails here, before and independently of this change,
with a varying number of `junction must update repeatedly before the pointer stops` errors
across runs; it touches no vegetation and is left alone.

Brush density is a separate defect and is not addressed here; see `VEG-05`.

### Vegetation LOD reference measurements — RENDER-02 (2026-09-13)

**Partly superseded:** every coverage and transition figure below is measured with both of a
crown's size terms divided out, and the crowns differed in size by a factor of two. See "The
crowns lost half their ground cover at the LOD switch" above. Kept for the colour and silhouette
measurements, which stand, and for the atlas work.

This is a partial material correction, with GPU acceptance still outstanding. The accepted
near path and all range constants are unchanged. The discontinuity at `TREE_NEAR_M` exchanges
alpha-scissored coverage, foliage backlight, wind and branch geometry together. It is not
solely a silhouette-authoring defect. Mid and far also collapse all variants to variant zero:
the pine/spruce and birch/aspen mixtures survive only in the near band.

**Original instrument and limitations (16 px).** `godot/tests/vegetation_lod_measure.gd` exports actual indexed
vertices, normals, vertex colours, UVs and material bindings from the live catalogue, without
constructing a gameplay scene. `tools/vegetation_lod_measure.py` uses the existing tooling
dependency NumPy to rasterize those arrays on the CPU. It reads every authored DDS alpha mip,
uses repeating bilinear/trilinear filtering, a `0.4` scissor, back-face culling on solid
surfaces, two-sided cards, and a z buffer. Crown bounds are the projected bounds of green
foliage vertices before scissoring; wood inside that rectangle participates in the pixels.
Bounds do not shrink to whichever pixels survive the mask. Each level is independently
scaled to exactly **16 projected crown pixels high** in a 64-square frame. This samples an
800 m transition-sized crown, not close-up meshes at identical world distance. It is one
apparent-size sample, not a calibrated recreation of the reference screenshot's camera.
Four headings (`0/90/180/270` degrees), elevation `45` degrees and pixel offsets `(0,0)` and
`(.5,.5)` give 96 samples across the 12 near variants, and 8 for each runtime distant mesh.
Statistics average those sample fractions and covered-pixel RGB means with equal weight.

Lighting is an explicitly isolated model: linear vertex albedo, a fixed white key in
normalized direction `(0.3,0.5,-0.8)` with radiance `pi`, ambient irradiance `.2`, roughness
`1` Burley diffuse, and the shared palette-gated backlight with its sRGB uniform converted
to linear. The diffuse/backlight relation follows
[Godot's lighting implementation](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/4.5/servers/rendering/renderer_rd/shaders/scene_forward_lights_inc.glsl).
There is no specular, sky, shadow, AO, fog, exposure, tone map or AA. Baseline wind is frozen
at time zero and instance origin zero. Controls make the near cards opaque, remove only
backlight, or advance the existing wind equation to two seconds. The CPU model mirrors
the current supported material equations; changes to those equations require updating the
instrument. It does **not** execute Godot shaders, prove their compilation/pass routing, or
measure GPU time. Godot `4.7.1.stable.official.a13da4feb` exposes only the dummy renderer
under `--headless` here; X11 and Wayland initialization both failed. The supplied aerial
reference was inspected, but no new in-engine capture was possible.

**Phase 1, before any runtime edits**, baseline `6ff3e638`:

| Species | Level | Coverage | Mean lit linear RGB | Indexed vertices | Triangles |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|---:|
| Conifer | Near | 14.1665% | .099427, .074731, .028881 | 2507–3485 | 895–1245 |
| Conifer | Mid | 66.3490% | .051704, .059977, .020682 | 290 | 102 |
| Conifer | Far | 56.3988% | .049625, .057565, .019850 | 77 | 28 |
| Broadleaf | Near | 15.2677% | .155700, .173385, .090827 | 2441–2741 | 865–965 |
| Broadleaf | Mid | 67.3260% | .114438, .136031, .041025 | 274 | 96 |
| Broadleaf | Far | 64.9725% | .110504, .131353, .039615 | 84 | 32 |

Coverage dominates this experiment. Making near cards opaque raises conifer coverage by
**41.1627 percentage points** and broadleaf by **50.3282 points**. Their opaque-card RGB
means become `(.048567,.059386,.019568)` and `(.117267,.144938,.037752)`: which surfaces
remain visible affects covered-pixel colour as well as occupied area. Removing backlight
changes near RGB by only `(-.000147,-.000537,-.000028)` and
`(-.000643,-.002152,-.000085)`, with no coverage change. The proposed second-place ranking
for backlight is therefore not supported under this light. At two seconds, mean coverage
changes by `+.04265 / -.04027` points, but `12.0429% / 10.7756%` of bbox pixels change
occupancy. Corresponding RGB means are `(.098285,.074493,.028641)` and
`(.158520,.176261,.093240)`. Mean absolute image RGB differences per bbox pixel, for
opaque cards / no backlight / two-second wind, are respectively
`.020577 / .000034 / .009556` (conifer) and `.063066 / .000146 / .019931` (broadleaf).

Geometry is not proved sub-pixel: at equal height the mean projected conifer width changes
from **14.9824 to 6.1648 to 6.0908 px**, and broadleaf from **12.5671 to 10.8315 to
13.6240 px**. The opaque-card control still differs from mid coverage by `11.0198 / 1.7302`
points. These are geometric diagnostics, not an additive causal decomposition: the change
in bounding box, normal distribution, variant mixture and internal occlusion interacts
with scissoring. Coverage, geometry and wind matter here; the exact ordering in a shadowed,
tonemapped gameplay frame remains unverified.

**Phase 2 (historical, `1bee14a7`).** Both distant levels used `vegetation_distant.gdshader`, one cached material
for both species. It keeps wood opaque, uses the existing backlight gate and scissoring,
and retains foliage fragments with a deterministic unsigned hash of quarter-metre
object-space cells. The shared retention `.22` comes from the phase-1 near/solid-mid
coverage ratios `.214 / .227`. No screen coordinates or time enter the cutout. This is a
spatial coverage mask, not a distance fade or a population decision. It costs `O(1)` integer
arithmetic per fragment, one interpolated local position, no textures, no CPU tick work and
no additional geometry. It can still alias at small sizes; it is not a filtered impostor.

| Species | Level | Coverage before → after | Lit RGB before → after |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conifer | Mid | 66.3490% → 18.6860% | (.051704,.059977,.020682) → (.054312,.062099,.021999) |
| Conifer | Far | 56.3988% → 13.3966% | (.049625,.057565,.019850) → (.050750,.059095,.020274) |
| Broadleaf | Mid | 67.3260% → 14.2128% | (.114438,.136031,.041025) → (.118060,.139771,.048084) |
| Broadleaf | Far | 64.9725% → 15.8465% | (.110504,.131353,.039615) → (.113840,.137092,.040634) |

The freshly rerun near rows match phase 1 exactly. All exported mesh arrays, including
near material bindings and the distant vertex colours, compare equal to baseline.

| Transition | Coverage delta before → after (percentage points) | Lit RGB delta before → after |
|---|---|---|
| Conifer near→mid | +52.1825 → +4.5195 | (-.047723,-.014754,-.008200) → (-.045115,-.012632,-.006883) |
| Conifer mid→far | -9.9501 → -5.2894 | (-.002079,-.002412,-.000832) → (-.003562,-.003004,-.001724) |
| Broadleaf near→mid | +52.0583 → -1.0548 | (-.041262,-.037355,-.049802) → (-.037640,-.033614,-.042743) |
| Broadleaf mid→far | -2.3535 → +1.6337 | (-.003935,-.004677,-.001411) → (-.004220,-.002679,-.007450) |

Absolute near→mid coverage error falls **91.3% / 98.0%**, and all near→mid RGB errors
shrink. Regressions: conifer's mid→far RGB step grows in every channel; broadleaf's grows
in red and blue, especially blue (`.001411` to `.007450`). Its coverage step reverses sign,
although its magnitude shrinks. Distant wind, pine geometry and variant collapse are not
fixed. The colour mismatch is not solved by matching geometric-area albedo or adding the
small backlight term. Do not mark `RENDER-02` complete or this result visually accepted.

**Primitive and draw budget.** All counts in the phase-1 table remain exact. A fixture
patch with 512 trees of each canopy species keeps **101376 mid triangles / 30720 far
triangles**, each with **two colour surface submissions**: deltas **0 / 0 triangles and
0 draws**. A populated near canopy still has 24 variant buckets × 2 surfaces = 48 canopy
submissions; its delta is also zero. Understory and shadow policy are untouched. These are
mesh/surface counts, not newly measured GPU pipeline counters. Keeping far saves 69.7%
of this patch's mid primitives. The measurements justify testing the material correction
before adding any intermediate geometry; they do not establish an optimal number of
levels or resolve the per-patch range problem. `RENDER-04` remains blocked on distance cost.

**Historical phase-2 verification and artifacts.** These runs preceded `1bee14a7`, over `6ff3e638`. Commands:

```sh
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 python3 tools/vegetation_lod_measure.py /tmp/render02/phase1
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 python3 tools/vegetation_lod_measure.py /tmp/render02/phase2

# Same direct invocation for vegetation_edit_test, vegetation_invalidation_test,
# and vegetation_land_cover_test. Inspect SCRIPT ERROR independently of exit/PASS.
```

Phase 1 ran before the material edit and phase 2 after it; each has 896 raw raster samples
(224 view/variant/level samples × 4 controls) in `measurements.json`, `summary.csv`, its
mesh export and source hashes. The later reporter also emits `transitions.csv`, reads the
distant coverage default from its shader, and hashes the atlas. It does not alter the
recorded raster equations or values. Both exports exit 0 with **0 SCRIPT ERROR**; the
initial standalone export also exits 0 with **0 SCRIPT ERROR**. The two analytic instrument
tests pass (run three times), checking full coverage, depth/alpha rejection and mip filtering.
The standalone/phase-1/phase-2 export catalogue times are `97.127 / 109.296 / 97.304 ms`;
these single setup samples are recorded separately from the matched benchmark below.
The final reporter run in `/tmp/render02/phase2-final` freshly exports the current tree,
exits 0 with **0 SCRIPT ERROR**, and reproduces all **896** phase-2 samples and summary
values exactly. Its catalogue setup is `106.546 ms`. It includes the transition CSV and
atlas hash. `/tmp/render02/final-source-sha256.txt` also identifies the exact changed
sources and deployed native library used for this handoff.

| Direct vegetation test | Baseline exit / SCRIPT ERROR | Final exit / SCRIPT ERROR | Final output |
|---|---|---|---|
| appearance | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | PASS vegetation appearance, shared material, LOD buckets, positions and empty density |
| edit | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | vegetation_edit_test: PASS |
| invalidation | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | No PASS line by design |
| land cover | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | PASS vegetation land cover publication, boundary edits and texture reuse |

The baseline correctness run's catalogue/upload-maximum times were `102.178 / 19.367 ms`
while the CPU raster was active; the final correctness run's were `106.175 / 19.675 ms`.
These are **not matched performance evidence**. Matched,
unprofiled runs use the existing appearance fixture (4096 placements per patch, four
warmup uploads, maximum of the following 24 uploads) sequentially after raster work ends.
The baseline scripts are exact `git show 6ff3e638:<path>` copies under
`/tmp/render02/benchmark/`, with only preload paths redirected to the copied baseline
species/renderer; the after runs use live scripts. Same official Godot executable and
deployed native library, default worker settings, no Rust rebuild, profiler or GPU renderer.

| Run order | Build | Catalogue ms | Upload maximum ms | Exit / SCRIPT ERROR |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | Before | 97.469 | 18.231 | 0 / 0 |
| 2 | After | 100.310 | 28.055 | 0 / 0 |
| 3 | After | 112.892 | 19.010 | 0 / 0 |
| 4 | Before | 106.679 | 24.958 | 0 / 0 |

| 7 | Before | 103.671 | 27.436 | 0 / 0 |
| 8 | After | 107.345 | 19.301 | 0 / 0 |

Median catalogue time regresses **100.570 → 107.510 ms (+6.940 ms, +6.9%)**; median upload
maximum is **22.1795 → 19.787 ms**. Wide ranges prevent claiming a reliable upload speedup.
The extra startup material remains a measured cost, not a performance acceptance. Full
logs/results are in `/tmp/render02/baseline-tests`, `final-tests` and `benchmark`; graphical
probe failures are `/tmp/render02-probe.log` and `/tmp/render02-x11.log` (0 SCRIPT ERROR,
but X11/Wayland initialization errors). Neither the unrelated failing full `run.sh --test`
chain nor Rust tests were run for this rendering-only change. GPU compilation, matched
unprofiled release frame times, other apparent sizes and an in-engine appearance check
remain required before accepting this candidate.

**Follow-up: filtered distant crowns and shadowed wood (`render02-tune`).**
The quarter-metre point mask is replaced by two deterministic object-space hashes at
adjacent power-of-two cell sizes. The maximum length of the local-position screen
derivatives selects the octave: `max(log2(footprint * 4), 0)`. Cells span approximately
half to two pixels. Their samples interpolate continuously, then use the CDF of a weighted
sum of uniform samples to avoid the retention dip of an uncorrected hash interpolation.
This is a procedural footprint filter, not a texture mip chain or temporal antialiasing.
The base crown retention was **.18** at this step, measured down from .22 because the
changed sampling increases the 16 px fill fraction. The recalibration below supersedes
that single figure with one retention per species. Between **4 and 8 metres per pixel**, a smoothstep
raises crown retention to one. This retention schedule never decreases with footprint;
finite pixel counts and sampled lighting can still fluctuate. Wood uses the same sample
with only **.04** retention and linear albedo **(.025,.030,.010)**, so it cannot remain as
an opaque bright stick. A fixed **1.08** foliage albedo multiplier was added at this step
to improve the RGB-vector match to near after removing bright wood. It is removed below,
because the near crown itself changed and the means now agree without it. Backlight still
uses the original palette gate, so recoloured wood does not acquire foliage backlight.

The fragment path remains **O(1)** with no textures, allocations, CPU simulation work or
new interpolants. It now evaluates two hashes, derivatives and octave/CDF arithmetic;
unchanged draw counts do **not** establish unchanged GPU cost. `tree_species.gd`, mesh
arrays, surface/material/instance counts and all ranges are unchanged. The complete live
before/after mesh exports compare equal. The shader token ban remains intact.

Fresh 16 px baseline (`1bee14a7`) → follow-up transitions, with linear covered-pixel RGB:

| Species / transition | Coverage step, pp before → after | RGB delta before → after |
|---|---:|---|
| Conifer 0->1 | +4.5195 → +3.6527 | (-0.045115,-0.012632,-0.006883) → (-0.030686,+0.005211,-0.001407) |
| Conifer 1->2 | -5.2894 → -3.1652 | (-0.003562,-0.003004,-0.001724) → (-0.009823,-0.011367,-0.003933) |
| Broadleaf 0->1 | -1.0548 → +1.7292 | (-0.037640,-0.033614,-0.042743) → (-0.032666,-0.025223,-0.046911) |
| Broadleaf 1->2 | +1.6337 → -1.0494 | (-0.004220,-0.002679,-0.007450) → (-0.009794,-0.011514,-0.003524) |

All four default-height coverage steps are inside ±5 pp; the fresh baseline conifer
mid→far value was actually **−5.2894 pp**, slightly outside that band. Near→mid RGB-vector
error (Euclidean norm) decreases for both species. This is not an all-channel improvement:
broadleaf near→mid blue regresses, conifer mid→far regresses in all channels, and broadleaf
mid→far red/green regress while blue improves. Forest appearance is not established by
these isolated means.

`--height` still defaults to 16 and retains `measurements.json`, `summary.csv` and
`transitions.csv`. The additional `--height-sweep` defaults to
`64,48,32,24,16,12,8,6,4,3,2`; values outside 2–64 are rejected before export (64 is the
frame height). `sweep.csv` averages the same headings, offsets, variants and four control
modes for each species/level/height. Pixel counts are sample means, coverage is the mean
of sample fractions, and RGB is the mean of covered-pixel means; an empty tiny mask has
zero coverage and RGB `(0,0,0)`. Up to four spawned standard-library workers measure
independent heights, preserving requested CSV order and reusing the single-height rows.
The work bound is O(number of heights × original raster cost), outside the game runtime.

The Python branch mirrors the shader's hash constants, octave/CDF equations, analytic
triangle derivatives, smoothstep and wood retention/albedo. A separate
scalar translation checked 49,152 hash/filter samples with **zero** discrepancy and
continuity around the .5/1/2/4/8 m octave boundaries. This validates the equations, not GPU
floating-point equivalence: the CPU raster uses NumPy doubles and analytic derivatives,
whereas GPU derivatives operate on fragment quads. The small new unit check compares
4 px and 64 px coverage over an isolated canopy plane's headings and pixel phases.

**The near crown was the defect all along: the foliage mask (`15fefe4a`).**
Every measurement above compares distant crowns against a near crown that was itself
wrong. At 16 px the near crown covered **.1417** of its own silhouette for a conifer and
**.1527** for a broadleaf. The `opaque_cards` control puts the same meshes at **.5533**
and **.6560**, so the geometry was never the shortfall: the baked alpha mask removed about
three quarters of it. The conifer's mean near colour came out at `(.0994,.0747,.0289)`,
redder than it was green, because most surviving pixels were bark rather than needles.

Three independent defects in `tools/bake_foliage_atlas.py` produced that:

- Each drawn cluster occupied only **.42 to .63** of its atlas cell, measured as the
  bounding box of alpha above the .4 threshold. A card quad maps the whole cell, so up to
  58% of every card was guaranteed empty. `fit_cell` now scales each cluster about its own
  centre until it fills the cell. Scaling about the centre, rather than recentring, keeps
  the cluster aligned with the branch tip its card hangs from.
- The clusters were sparse inside that extent, at **.29 to .55** covered. Counts and widths
  rise: 78 blades instead of 52 for the generic broadleaf, 7 twigs instead of 5 and 26
  needle pairs instead of 23 for the conifer sprays. Measured cell coverage rises from
  **.158-.231** to **.434-.502**.
- `correct()` chose the representable coverage closest to the target. Once a mip holds one
  texel per cell the closest choice to .44 is zero, so a card vanished outright. A 512 px
  atlas with 2x2 cells reaches that mip at roughly 800 m, the far edge of the near band. It
  now takes the smallest representable coverage that **reaches** the target, so an
  unresolvable cluster fills instead of disappearing. This is the same principle the
  distant hash uses above. On the larger mips the representable ratios are dense and the
  choice does not move; the corrected chain now reads .467, .467, .467, .467, .469, .477,
  .500, .562, 1.000 from level 0.

No geometry changed. Vertex and triangle counts, surfaces, instances, draw counts, LOD
ranges and the 512 px atlas size are all identical. More fragments survive the scissor.
E13 measured this scatter as vertex- and draw-bound rather than fill-bound, so this is the
cheap direction, but **the GPU cost is not measured**.

Near silhouette fill then required the distant retention to be recalibrated upward, and the
two species need different values: a solid spruce cone fills far more of its own bounding
box than a broadleaf dome fills its own, so one shared figure cannot match both. There are
now two materials sharing one shader, at **.50** for conifer and **.70** for broadleaf.
Placement already draws the species separately, so the second material adds no draw call.
The `1.08` foliage gain is removed with it.

Silhouette fill against apparent size, `baseline` mode, before and after:

| Species / level | 64 px | 48 px | 32 px | 24 px | 16 px | 12 px | 8 px | 6 px | 4 px |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Conifer near, before | .202 | | .171 | | .142 | | | | |
| Conifer near, after | .362 | .347 | .345 | .355 | .416 | .475 | .551 | .575 | .604 |
| Conifer mid, after | .355 | .364 | .366 | .401 | .424 | .421 | .442 | .469 | .552 |
| Conifer far, after | .336 | .340 | .350 | .357 | .376 | .363 | .246 | .383 | .677 |
| Broadleaf near, before | .334 | | .274 | | .153 | | | | |
| Broadleaf near, after | .473 | .474 | .479 | .485 | .500 | .507 | .540 | .610 | .785 |
| Broadleaf mid, after | .455 | .457 | .490 | .504 | .516 | .521 | .545 | .590 | .705 |
| Broadleaf far, after | .428 | .428 | .445 | .460 | .498 | .467 | .539 | .494 | .578 |

The before rows fall as a tree shrinks. That fall is the measured form of a forest that
gains weight with every step the camera takes toward it. The after rows never fall outside
sampling noise, which is the invariant this section now holds the catalogue to. The rise
below about 8 px is deliberate on both paths: a cluster whose cell no longer resolves
fills, and a real forest at that range is a solid dark mass. Values at and below 8 px are
heavily quantized, and the conifer far dip at 8 px is that quantization on a three-ring
lathe, not a retention change.

Default-height (16 px) transitions, against the `1bee14a7` measurement:

| Transition | Coverage step, pp at `1bee14a7` | pp now |
|---|---:|---:|
| Conifer near->mid | +4.5195 | +0.7574 |
| Conifer mid->far | -5.2894 | -4.7604 |
| Broadleaf near->mid | -1.0548 | +1.5754 |
| Broadleaf mid->far | +1.6337 | -1.8487 |

Every near->mid and mid->far RGB delta is now within `.0096` on each channel, against
`.0427` for the worst channel at `1bee14a7`. The conifer near mean turns from
`(.0994,.0747,.0289)` to `(.0535,.0614,.0207)`: green now exceeds red, so the near spruce
reads as needles rather than as bark.

One measurement bug was fixed alongside this. `raster()` framed the silhouette with a box
of exactly the projected size, which at the smallest sweep steps can contain no pixel
centre at all and left the coverage ratio with an empty denominator. That is why the first
`sweep.csv` was empty. The frame is now held at a minimum of one pixel either side of the
centre.

Still unverified: GPU shader compilation, frame cost and on-screen appearance. Patch
granularity, distant wind, and the collapse of every variant to zero at mid and far range
all remain open.

### Accepted canopy land cover — RENDER-05 (2026-09-12)

Before this change the ground mask had been completely removed: `stand_field()` only
selected candidate stands in Rust, and the terrain shader had no land-cover input. The
previous roadmap statement about a shipped water/slope-gated shader mirror was stale.
The following contract supersedes the historical ground-mask experiments below.

`get_vegetation_land_cover` publishes derived R8 bytes and world bounds for each terrain
patch. The world-aligned texel size is **8 m**, independent of saved `canopy_cell_m`.
A full 510 m patch carries 66–67 texels per axis including a one-texel filter border
(4356–4489 bytes). Neighboring patches publish identical samples where their borders overlap,
so the shader's single bilinear texture fetch is continuous across patch edges.

Generated stems pass the same `evaluate_cell` as the scatter; tombstones suppress them,
and authored canopy additions pass the same `placement_clear` on every rebuild. Building
site queries are prepared before the parallel walk. Authored bushes and rocks use the canopy
address grid but contribute no crown coverage. Each tree contributes a disc with a species
substrate radius of 3 m (conifer) or 3.5 m (broadleaf), multiplied by its accepted instance
scale. These footprints are independent of cosmetic mesh variants, LOD and wind. An 8×8
fixed sample grid per texel forms the crown-disc union at 1 m spacing, converted to an R8
area fraction. Atomic bitwise OR preserves overlap and produces identical bytes regardless
of Rayon scheduling; no candidate body allocates. The build allocates one temporary patch
bitmask buffer (~35 KB); conversion allocates the packed bridge output once. The final
~4 KB contiguous R8 packing pass is deliberately serial; indexed candidate work uses Rayon.

Cost is O((K + A) × indexed footprint-query cost + T): K candidate cells and A authored
additions in the patch plus crown/filter border, and T fixed-size output texels. A crown
touches at most nine texels with 64 samples each. The existing index preparation may pay
for a dirty building-site index rebuild once; no world population scan or new spatial index
is introduced. Coverage is built on residency/invalidation, never per tick or fragment.

Textures follow terrain's active/spare image and `ImageTexture` ownership, including resource
pool reuse and terrain stage/commit. Unchanged coverage is reused during unrelated terrain
mesh staging. Plant-only and neighboring surface changes refresh at most one resident
coverage patch per frame after terrain/network publication. Validity compares the **two
existing** revision streams in the 3×3 patch neighborhood, including nonresident neighbors;
there is no coverage generation, no new edit ownership, and no save-format change. Capturing
revisions and candidates under the same core lock prevents stamping old coverage as current.
Staged terrain rejects a coverage revision mismatch before publication.

The material blends needle litter/duff and moss hues, matching the incoming grass albedo's
luminance before blending. Coverage changes no lighting, shadow visibility, grass palette,
chroma gain or hillshade tint. Tree shadows remain responsible for canopy light occlusion.

Fresh headless validation uses the release GDExtension from `cargo build --release`, copied
to `godot/bin/libmetrum_rise.so`. Direct commands are
`godot --headless --path godot --log-file /tmp/render05/<test>-engine.log --script res://tests/<test>.gd`.
`vegetation_edit_test`, `vegetation_appearance_test`, `vegetation_invalidation_test`,
`vegetation_land_cover_test` and `network_tool_chunk_renderer_test` each exit **0**, with
**0 `SCRIPT ERROR` entries**. The new native test covers R8 publication, a boundary plant,
clear-cut/removal, both revision streams, stage isolation and `ImageTexture` reuse. The Rust
oracle compares every texel with accepted canopy products, allowing only the <0.1 mm
roundoff from reconstructing packed local f32 positions; overlapping border bytes must
match exactly. Logs are under `/tmp/render05/`.

Fresh Rust verification (`cargo ... --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml`):

the pre-existing `clippy::mut_from_ref` error at

so this run does not establish that background edits cost nothing. Inspection bounds the

### The generator became the saved population (2026-09-12)

The scatter's stand layout, density and arrangement were four constants in
`vegetation_api.rs`. They are now `VegetationConfig` in `rust/src/simulation/vegetation.rs`,
chosen per world and persisted in the save at format version 60. That is the whole vegetation
population: a Finnish stand density over the default world is around `10^10` stems, so storing
the trees is not an option, while storing the parameters that generate them costs sixteen bytes.
Player edits now ride on top as a sparse authored delta (`VEG-01`, save format 61).
`VegetationEdits` keys tombstones and authored additions by `(layer, cell_x, cell_z)`;
`evaluate_cell` is the single generated-candidate decision used by queries, removal and paint.
Queries retain O(K) bounded candidates, one expected O(1) edit lookup per cell, and O(A)
work for authored plants in those cells. Storage is O(edits), with no additional spatial index.
Parallel candidate evaluation allocates nothing per cell; actual edit commits own the sparse
store's persistent allocations. Point placement validates the footprint immediately; brush
stamps restore tombstones or fill rejected canopy candidates with the original jitter, yaw and
scale. The player addresses the canopy grid (including authored bush/rock species); the generated
understory remains a near-only layer. Authored placements remain visible when generation is disabled.

Vegetation patch revisions use the terrain renderer's layout but do not change terrain surface
revisions. Only patches containing changed plants advance. Save rows sort by layer, cell_z and
cell_x, preserving addition order within a cell; versions 58–60 load with no edits. Save/load
reproduces the packed placements. Existing save timestamps still vary with wall-clock save time.
A road, building site or terraform placed later clears an authored plant exactly as it clears a
generated candidate: `scatter_layer` re-runs `placement_clear` over the authored plants it is
about to return, as one parallel pass allocating once for the patch and skipped entirely for a
patch that holds none. The verdict is re-derived per fetch rather than stored, so removing the
surface restores the plant bit for bit, which is already how a generated candidate behaves. The
existing terrain payload revision drives the rebuild, because every road, site and terraform edit
funnels through `bump_terrain_payload_patch_generations`, which `_is_patch_stale` already reads.
Clearing a radius still finds and counts an authored plant hidden under a surface, which prunes
it from the store.

The player reaches all of this through `vegetation_tool.gd`, a Terrain-submenu tool with two
modes - plant one species, or clear plants - drawn as a ground ring at the cursor's surface hit.
The radius is the only size control, and it also selects the dispatch: at `MIN_RADIUS_M` a plant
lands exactly under the cursor through `add_vegetation_at`, and above it the disc fills the
4 m planting lattice plus generator candidates through `paint_vegetation`. That removes the point/brush mode and the
radius control from the panel, which leaves a preset choice and a clear. Ctrl and the mouse wheel
step the radius geometrically, because no fixed step serves both a one-tree cursor and a 1 km
clear-cut, and stepping down clamps on the minimum so the point dispatch stays reachable. The
camera must not zoom on that combination, so `_handle_zoom_wheel` refuses a ctrl-held wheel.
Shift and the wheel cycle the tool-owned ordered brush options (Conifer, Broadleaf, Bush, Rock),
wrapping in both directions and synchronizing the dropdown without firing its selection handler.
Each option maps a display label to an existing native species ordinal; adding an option requires
only extending that list. The popup forwards both wheel gestures; Ctrl takes priority when both
modifiers are held, and Shift also suppresses camera zoom. `E` toggles planting/erasing while the
vegetation tool is active, sharing mode state with the Remove toggle. The ring reports footprint
and mode by size and colour. On option or mode changes, an outlined billboard `Label3D` above its
centre shows the option name or `Remove`, using `UIStyle.TEXT_PRIMARY` or `TEXT_ALERT`. The label
holds for one second and fades over 0.25 seconds; projection keeps its size and offset constant
in pixels, including at the ring's last position during popup input grabs. Navigation and label
updates are O(1), independent of world population and brush radius; the label is allocated once.
A stroke continues on held-button motion whenever it is a brush or a clear, and restamps
after half a radius of travel, so it overlaps without issuing a native call per pixel.

Every one of those stamps is reversible. `add_vegetation_at`, `remove_vegetation_at` and
`paint_vegetation` each record a bounded inverse journal before they touch a cell: one entry per
changed cell holding that cell's delta as the stroke found it, plus the render-patch keys whose
revisions have to advance again on the way back. Storage is O(changed cells), and a cell the
generator still owned stores `None` and allocates nothing, which is the whole of a clear-cut over
unedited forest. A dragged stroke would otherwise fill the 30-entry history with fragments of one
gesture, so the tool mints a stroke id on the press that opens a drag, every stamp of that drag
carries it, and a stamp merges into the entry on top of the stack only when that entry carries the
same id, keeping each cell's earliest record. The id is the whole point and a "this is not the
first stamp" flag is not enough: a stamp that changes nothing journals nothing and pushes no
entry, so the first stamp of a clear that lands on bare ground leaves the previous action on top
of the stack, and the stamps after it then attached the clear to the planting underneath. One
`Ctrl+Z` reversed both. A point placement carries stroke zero, which matches no entry including
another zero, because one click is one action. Restoring a
journal is independent per cell and only has to change each patch revision, so the hashed
iteration order cannot alter the result. `Ctrl+Z` reaches this through the existing global
`undo_action`, which the vegetation tool does not intercept.

An authored plant can now name the modelled tree it is, not only its species. A species covers
several meshes that the renderer picks between from the placement's appearance seed - two of
every three conifer variants are pine and the rest spruce, two of every three broadleaf variants
birch and the rest aspen - so a conifer planted before this was a lottery the player could not
call. `AuthoredPlant` carries a `variant` pinned over that choice, biased by one so that zero
means the seed still decides, which is every generated plant and every plant authored before the
pin existed. It is persisted in save format 63; a save below that has no column and reads back
unpinned, which is the behaviour it was written under. A pin past the variants the renderer
models for that species is rejected at load rather than drawn as nothing.

Lane five of a packed placement carries both, the species ordinal in its low two bits and the
biased variant above them, because widening the stride from six floats would cost the whole
scatter buffer a seventh for a field that is zero on nearly every instance. An unpinned plant
therefore packs to the bare species ordinal exactly as it did before, so the generator's output
is unchanged bit for bit. The split reads out to `TREE_NEAR_M` and no further: past 800 m every
plant of a species draws variant zero, so a planted spruce stand reads as spruce up close and as
generic conifer in the distance.

The brush is now driven by named presets rather than by a bare species ordinal.
`vegetation_api/brush.rs` owns the table, because a preset decides what is planted and that is
a simulation decision, not a label: each entry carries the fraction of its lattice it keeps, the
instance scale band it plants in, and a weighted mix of species and the meshes each may use.
`paint_vegetation` and `add_vegetation_at` take a preset ordinal, and `BRUSH_OPTIONS` in
`vegetation_tool.gd` only names the presets and fixes the order the wheel cycles them in. The
first four ordinals are the species the brush offered before, unpinned and at full density, so
an unpinned preset produces the same plants it produced before the table existed.

The table holds eleven and the brush offers nine. Four are unpinned species, four are the named
trees (pine, spruce, birch, aspen), and three are mixes. `Mixed forest 1` keeps 0.85 of the
lattice at Finnish growing-stock weights - pine 50, spruce 30, birch 15, aspen 5 - which is
about 530 stems/ha against the real 400-700 of a managed stand. `Mixed forest 2` keeps 0.10,
about 62 stems/ha, and widens the scale band to `0.95-1.45` because a tree with room around it
is larger than one that grew up under a canopy. `Mixed forest 3` keeps 0.35, narrows the mix to
birch and pine, and lowers the band to `0.45-0.75`. The three are numbered rather than named
because only the first describes a real stand: the other two move the density dial and the size
dial without yet reading as any particular place.

The brush does not offer the unpinned conifer and broadleaf. Once pine and spruce are both
nameable, "conifer" is an unnamed two-to-one mix of them, inherited from how the renderer
numbers its variants rather than chosen, and a mix belongs in a mix preset where its ratio is
written down. They stay in the table because they are what the generator plants, and therefore
what a repaint of a cleared cell has to match to collapse back to no stored edit.

Density presets can only thin. The lattice stays at the 4 m `VEG-05` shipped, which is already
625 points/ha and above a real stand, so a preset subtracts from it rather than tightening it;
nothing here raises the instance count a stroke can reach. Thinning and the mix are pure
functions of the lattice cell and the stream's salt, so a stroke thins to the same plants
however its points are ordered and a repeat of it adds nothing rather than filling its own gaps.
The mix pick is a scan over a handful of weights and the variant pick is an index, so neither
allocates per lattice point. A stroke also clears nothing: painting a sparse mix over standing
forest adds scattered trees to it and does not thin the forest to match.

A preset costs the stroke a little. Matched fresh release runs on four workers, same machine
and same session, price a 64 m stroke of 862 plants at `738.74 us` without the preset table and
`793.08 us` with it, which is `+54 us` or `+7.4%`. The per-point work a preset adds is a
thinning compare, a weighted pick and a scale-band compare, all O(1) and none allocating; a
single-choice preset skips the weighted pick entirely, which is worth `56 us` of that on its
own. The path is per stroke and not per tick, and the figure sits against the `112.24 us` a
50-plant stroke cost before `VEG-05` made the brush dense. The `709.83 us` recorded under
`VEG-05` is an older build and is not comparable directly: the same commit measures `738.74 us`
here.

One consequence of the pin reaches back into the tombstone contract. A stroke that repaints a
cleared cell with the species the generator had chosen still collapses to no stored edit, but
only while it is unpinned. A player who named the tree gets that tree authored over the
tombstone instead, because the mesh the generator's own seed would regrow is not the one they
asked for.

Bulldoze can finally see a tree. `get_bulldoze_target_at` answered `building` and `road` only,
so the one class of object the vegetation brush had just made addressable was the one the
bulldoze cursor ignored, and clearing a single tree meant opening the Terrain submenu. It now
resolves a vegetation target after both of those and never before them, because a plant under a
building or a road is hidden rather than clickable. The lookup is `plant_at` in
`vegetation_api.rs` rather than in `editing.rs`, because the lattice arithmetic and
`evaluate_cell` belong to the module that owns them; it stays immutable, since bulldoze already
prepares the same building-site query index the brush does. It visits a fixed 4 m cursor disc
over both layers, which is at most four canopy cells and nine understory cells at the shipped
spacings, costs O(K + A) in those cells' candidates and additions rather than in world
population, and allocates nothing per candidate. Ties break by layer, then row-major cell, then
authored order, so two runs over the same state always pick the same plant.

It targets exactly what the renderer draws, which is why the clearance test is asymmetric: a
generated candidate was already cleared inside `evaluate_cell`, so only authored plants are put
through `placement_clear`, the same split `get_decorative_tree_patch` makes when it packs a
patch. The target id packs the plant's stored `f32` position bits, because the authored vector
is compacted on removal and an index into it does not survive an unrelated clear in the same
cell, while the position does; re-resolving at the target's own centre therefore finds that
plant at zero distance and reproduces its id, which is what `bulldoze_prepared_target_internal`
checks before it deletes anything.

Deletion adds no mutator. It calls the brush's own `remove_at` at radius zero and stroke zero,
so a bulldozed plant writes the same tombstone or the same authored removal the tool's clear
writes, reuses its inverse journal for one undo entry per click, and advances the same render
patch revision. Radius zero is an exact position match, which is also why a plant sharing an
exact position with another is refused rather than targeted: that mutator would take both, and
bulldoze is one target per click. The hover shape is a sixteen-point ring at the plant's crown
radius scaled by its instance size, so the existing polygon path draws it unchanged and
`bulldoze_tool.gd` gains only a `kind` branch; bushes and rocks have no entry in the canopy
crown table and fall back to a metre. The cursor ray still resolves against the ground, so the
player aims at the trunk rather than the crown and the 4 m pick radius is what makes that
forgiving.

`vegetation.gd` ORs the independent vegetation revision into `_is_patch_stale` and stamps
it alongside `surface_generation` at upload, reading both before the placement fetch so an edit
landing mid-fetch is not stamped as already rendered.

They are saved state and not a video setting. Once a tree can be planted and cleared it is
gameplay state, so two machines loading one save have to generate the same forest; a dense world
on a weak machine runs slower rather than thinning itself out. Saves written before version 60
load the shipped values, so an existing city keeps the forest it was built in.

**Coverage and density are separate axes with different costs.** Coverage is the fraction of the
world inside a stand. It only moves a threshold, so it is free: instance count follows the area
it selects. Density is canopy stems per hectare, and it is delivered by sizing the grid cell
rather than by changing the acceptance rate, so the accepted fraction of candidates stays put and
only the spacing moves. Halving the cell quadruples canopy instances and sixteens the understory,
which is why density is clamped at `121.875` stems/ha (an `8 m` cell, four times the shipped
grid). That ceiling is a renderer limit and not a generator one: a real Finnish stand is
`500-1500` stems/ha, which needs a `2.6-4.5 m` cell and `13-38x` the instances. `RENDER-04`
raises it. The default `30.46875` stems/ha is the shipped `16 m` grid at `0.78` acceptance kept
exact, so the default world generates the population every measurement in this file was taken
against. Cell size is quantised to the millimetre, because the spacing decides how many candidate
cells a patch covers and a float ulp either side of a round number could change that count at a
patch boundary.

**The two-sine field had to go, and not because of its shape.** `woodland()` was
`sin(x * 0.0031) * cos(z * 0.0043) + sin((x + z) * 0.008) * 0.3`, with wavelengths fixed in world
metres at `2027 m` and `785 m`. Across the `500 m` sandbox world in `user://worlds` the field
never completes a period: evaluating its corners puts the entire map inside one stand bar a
single corner sample that clips the threshold by `0.006`. A small map therefore had no stand
structure at all and a coverage dial would have done nothing on it. The replacement is three
octaves of smoothed value noise at `500 m`, `225 m` and `90 m`.

Coverage means an area fraction on any world, and it is measured rather than mapped. The field is
a sum of octaves with no closed-form distribution, so `resolve` sweeps it on a `192x192` grid over
the world, sorts, and takes the matching quantile as the threshold. That is `37k` samples and one
sort, once per world load, and never on a per-patch path. The default coverage of `0.565` is the
measured stand fraction of the two-sine field over the `18 km` world, so the default world keeps
the amount of forest it had while the stands themselves move.

**Global coverage being right says nothing about what one player sees, and the first attempt got
that wrong.** Scaling the stand feature size to an eighth of the world gave the `18 km` world
`2250 m` features, which is eight noise lattice cells per axis. Global coverage measured a correct
`0.565` while the `2 km` window around spawn measured `0.002`: the first E13 probe of that build
returned `43,162` resident trees against `80,815`, `2.26 M` primitives against `9.52 M`, because
the near patches had become open ground. Sampled across 225 spawn windows the local coverage ran
`0.000` to `1.000` at a standard deviation of `0.316`. The old two-sine field's own standard
deviation was `0.007`, which is the real reason it looked stable everywhere: it was not a stand
pattern at all but a regular `2 km` ripple, and every window of it held the same 56% forest.

The stand size is therefore a metric constant, `500 m`, and only a world too small to hold one
compresses it to an eighth of its shorter side. Across the same 225 windows that gives mean
`0.551`, standard deviation `0.123`, range `0.199` to `0.816` - landscape variation instead of a
coin flip - and the `2 km` window at spawn measures `0.566` against the old field's `0.564`,
which falls out of the scale rather than being fitted to it. A test pins the local range, because
nothing else would catch a retuned feature size putting the player back in a meadow.

One consequence is honest to record: peak cost now depends on where you stand. The densest `2 km`
window carries `0.816` coverage against `0.566` at the probe viewpoint, and that window is the
near understory ring, so the worst spot on the map should sit around `1.4x` the near geometry
measured below - roughly back at the `9.52 M` primitives and `12.26 ms` that the previous build
paid everywhere. That is an estimate scaled from the coverage ratio, not a measurement; the E13
pivot is fixed and does not visit that window.

The seed mixes into both layers' candidate salts as well as the stand field, so two worlds on the
same terrain differ in where the stands are and in how the plants sit inside them. It is cheap
because the scatter already hashed integer cell coordinates. Rocks do not scale with density:
they are geology rather than forest.

`scatter_layer` is now a free function rather than a method, because it never used `self` and a
test needs to drive one layer without an engine.

The parameters reach the simulation through `start_new_game`, which is a separate entry point
from `load_world_definition` rather than an extra argument on it. The two do different things:
`load_world_definition` opens the land with the shipped forest and is what the world editor,
the benchmarks and the GPU probes use, where the forest is not the subject and has to stay
fixed for results to stay comparable; `start_new_game` is the gameplay path that carries the
player's choice. Both resolve the config against the loaded extent inside
`reset_to_blank_world_runtime`, and both sanitise it there, so no menu can start a world the
generator cannot reproduce from its save.

The choosing happens in `new_game_dialog.gd`, which opens after a world is picked. Its defaults,
its density range and the grid spacing it reads back all come from `VegetationOptions`, a
`RefCounted` class that exists because the main menu holds no `SimulationNode` and therefore has
nothing to ask. The alternative was four literals in GDScript, which would have outlived the
renderer limit that sets the ceiling: when `RENDER-04` lifts it, the slider follows without a
second edit. Density is shown as stems per hectare next to the cell it produces, because that
cell is what the generator actually varies and it is quantised - a dialog computing it locally
would eventually disagree with the world it started.

### The woodland ground mask is gone (2026-09-12)

Three versions of a forest-floor ground mask shipped in one day and all three were wrong for
the same reason, which is not a colour reason. The shader decided where forest floor was drawn
by evaluating `woodland_field`, a hand-maintained GLSL copy of `woodland()` in
`rust/src/nodes/simulation_node/vegetation_api.rs`. Nothing linked the two at runtime, so the
ground was not being coloured by trees. It was being coloured by a sine wave that the scatter
happens to consult as well.

The consequence is easy to state and was the thing that finally settled it: disabling the
vegetation renderer leaves the mask completely intact. Ground reads as forest with no tree
standing on it, and no per-fragment mirror of a procedural field can ever do otherwise. The
earlier repairs - gating on watermap depth and slope, dropping the authored luminance from
`0.078` to `0.100` to `0.245`, capping the blend at `0.62` - each removed a symptom. The mask
still coloured ground the player never planted and could not clear.

Two things were conflated and both were derived from the same sine wave:

- **Land cover** - moss, needle litter, dwarf shrub. A real substrate difference that persists
  in full sun. This is map data and belongs in a terrain layer beside heightmap and watermap,
  sourced from the accepted population.
- **Canopy occlusion** - shade. This is lighting. It moves with the sun, and the vegetation
  renderer already casts it.

Painting albedo for the second is faking an occlusion term the renderer computes correctly.
The reason the floor does not go dark under our trees is density, not colour: canopy scatter is
about `30 trees/ha` against `500-1500/ha` in a real stand, so there are not enough crowns to
cast the shade. Both reference sources agree. Cities: Skylines 1 paints no forest floor at all
and its ground under a dense tree cluster measures `0.469` against `0.512` for its open ground,
a `92%` cast-shadow difference; its stands still read as stands. An autumn photograph from the
same viewpoint as the in-game captures shows park ground running uniform right up to and under
the trees, with the far hillside dark because it is a wall of crowns.

Removed: the uniforms `terrain_woodland_strength`, `terrain_woodland_floor`,
`terrain_woodland_floor_blend`, `terrain_woodland_litter_scale`,
`terrain_woodland_litter_strength`, `terrain_woodland_edge_break_scale` and
`terrain_woodland_edge_break_strength`; the `woodland_field` mirror; the mask's water and slope
gates; the `woodland_mask` parameter of `apply_natural_land_variation` and the `* 0.55` damping
of its three tints; and the `* 0.35` damping of the grass detail layers. Open-ground colour is
now what the whole land surface gets. `woodland()` stays in Rust, where it governs placement
and nothing else, and its Rust-side pin test went with the mirror it existed to protect.

This is not a deferral of the forest-floor idea. Land cover may come back, but only sourced
from the vegetation that is actually there, which cannot happen while vegetation is a pure
function of position with no identity, no persistence and no way for the player to add or
remove a single tree. That is `VEG-01`, and it is a must-decide before any upstream PR. Until
it lands, no ground shading is derived from `woodland()` in either language.

### Forest floor, understory density and where scatter cost actually lives (2026-09-12)

The ground under a forest used to keep the open-meadow colour, so a stand read as trees
standing on a lawn. The cause was that the terrain never knew where the forest was:
`terrain_surface_color` selected its biome from elevation, macro noise and ruggedness, and
its existing `conifer_dark` entry was reached through `ruggedness * 0.34`, so flat woodland
got none of it while a bare rocky slope got all of it. The scatter, meanwhile, decides where
trees go from `woodland()` in `vegetation_api.rs`, which shares nothing with that selection.

`woodland_field()` in `terrain.gdshader` now mirrors `woodland()`, and the ground blends to
`terrain_woodland_floor` across `smoothstep(-0.25, 0.30, ...)`, straddling the `> -0.1`
placement threshold so the substrate change reads as a boundary between stand and open
ground rather than a painted line. The meadow, scrub and dry-open tints are damped by the
same mask; all three brighten, and layering them at full strength over a forest floor undid
it. (This section originally described the tint as canopy shade and suppressed those three
outright. Both were wrong - see "The forest floor was shade baked into albedo" above.) Rock,
shore and cliff still win, so stone and
waterline are unaffected. The field covers about `57%` of the world.

Nothing in the build links the GLSL mirror to its Rust original, so
`woodland_field_matches_the_terrain_shader_mirror` pins four samples, two accepted and two
rejected, and a change to the formula now breaks that test rather than silently darkening
ground where no forest grows.

**The same density multiplier costs wildly different amounts on different layers, because
cost follows the area each layer draws across.** Density is not free - both experiments below
change density and both change cost. What the range term explains is why the *same* `4x`
costs `19.8 ms` on one layer and `1.89 ms` on the other. Candidate work is the sampled area
over the cell area; render work is the accepted population times mesh cost times pass count,
plus pixel overdraw. Matched `E13` sweeps on one release binary each, same world, unprofiled,
`yaw180` scatter isolated as `full - off`:

| Change | scatter | prims | note |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| baseline | `+5.59 ms` | `7.2 M` | `CANOPY_CELL_M 16`, `UNDERSTORY_CELL_M 8` |
| `4x` canopy density | `+25.4 ms` | `34.2 M` | `CANOPY_CELL_M 8`; unaffordable |
| `4x` understory density | `+8.73 ms` | `12.5 M` | `UNDERSTORY_CELL_M 4` |
| `4x` understory, no bush shadows | `+7.48 ms` | `9.7 M` | shipped |

Draw calls moved by six across the canopy experiment, so this is entirely primitive cost.
Canopy reaches `TREE_FAR_M = 4500 m` and understory only `BUSH_RANGE_M = 420 m`, a ratio of
`115x` in area, which is why quadrupling the understory costs a fifth of what quadrupling the
canopy costs and buys most of the same closed-forest read.

This also corrects an earlier expectation recorded in this file. Shortening `TREE_NEAR_M`
through finer LOD granularity would make the *near* band affordable, but the near band is not
what blocks canopy density: at `30 trees/ha` the band from `2000 m` to `4500 m` covers
`51 km2` against the near band's `2.0 km2`, so distant cones dominate the primitive count even
at `24` triangles each. Canopy density needs the far band to get cheaper — impostors, or a
distance-graded population — and finer near-band granularity is a separate, additional fix.

Understory now casts no shadow. The key light runs four PSSM cascades with blended splits, so
each bush was submitted up to five times, and bushes are the densest species; its own shadow
sits under a canopy shadow that already darkens the same ground. Measured at `1.26 ms` and
`2.8 M` primitives on `yaw180`.

Remaining, unfixed: open ground keeps a vivid saturated green that comes from the grass albedo
photo mixed at `terrain_grass_albedo_strength = 0.90`, not from the authored palette, and the
conifer patch-switch brightness step is not albedo. The area-weighted near-mesh mean derived
below moved the conifer distant crown only from `(0.049, 0.115, 0.039)` to
`(0.056, 0.122, 0.042)`, so the step is that the far cone is a solid volume where the near tree
is mostly holes. Albedo cannot express that; impostors can.

### The forest floor was shade baked into albedo, and it had to go (2026-09-12)

**Superseded:** the woodland ground mask this section tunes was removed the same day; see
"The woodland ground mask is gone" above. Kept for the measurements and for why the
intermediate fixes did not work.


Gating the woodland mask on water and slope stopped it appearing under lakes, but it did
not answer the prior question: what is a darkened ground *modelling*? The honest answer is
nothing. It was standing in for canopy occlusion that the scatter does not produce, and a
stand-in painted into the albedo cannot behave like shade - it stays dark in full sun, at
every hour of the day cycle, and through transparent water, which is exactly where it was
first noticed.

The reference photographs settle it. In `imgs/reference/topdown-1.png`, a closed boreal
canopy from directly overhead, **the ground is not visible anywhere**. Every dark value in
the frame is shadowed crown: the darkest decile measures luminance `0.060` at hue `163` and
saturation `0.88`, which is deep saturated green, not the desaturated near-black the floor
uniform held. The whole-frame medians across the three aerials are `0.261`, `0.296` and
`0.278`. Forest darkness is a high-frequency crown-to-crown structure. The mask was a
low-frequency field several hundred metres across.

Cities: Skylines 1 makes the same point from the other side (`imgs/games-external/cs-1.png`).
Its ground under a dense tree cluster measures luminance `0.469` against `0.512` for its open
ground - **92%**, a cast-shadow difference and nothing more. It paints no forest floor at all,
and its stands still read as stands, because the trees do that work.

So the floor is now a substrate change rather than a shade:

| | authored luminance | hue | vs open ground |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| first version | `0.078` | `86` | `23%` |
| second version | `0.100` | `86` | `30%` |
| **now** | **`0.245`** | **`62`** | **`73%`** |
| open ground (`inland_base`) | `0.334` | `72` | - |

Moss, needle litter and dwarf shrub are genuinely browner and less saturated than meadow
grass, and genuinely close to it in value. That is all the ground can honestly say. Three
further changes stop the mask behaving like paint:

- `terrain_woodland_floor_blend = 0.62` caps the blend, so meadow always shows through and
  the macro variation and elevation ramp survive inside the stand. Full replacement is what
  made it one flat region with a hard edge. Effective woodland ground lands at `83%` of open
  ground.
- `apply_natural_land_variation` is damped by `woodland_mask * 0.55` instead of suppressed
  outright. A stand with no macro variation reads as a painted region.
- `apply_grass_detail` is damped by `woodland_mask * 0.35` instead of `0.90`. A forest floor
  has more small-scale fibre than a meadow, not less; removing it was the other half of why
  the mask read as paint.

Measured in the `E13` `yaw180` frame, foreground ground moved from luminance `0.134` at hue
`96` to `0.323` at hue `80`, which is inside the photographic band. Matched, one release
binary, unprofiled, scatter isolated as `full - off`: `+7.14 ms` and `9.52 M` primitives
against `+7.26 ms` and `9.52 M`. Identical primitive count - this is one `mix()` factor and
two attenuations on paths that already ran.

None of this closes the real gap, and it is not meant to. If ground is visible across a
stand at all then the canopy is not closed, and no ground colour substitutes for crowns that
are not there. That is `RENDER-04`.

### The land palette was 30 degrees off, and the woodland mask was ungated (2026-09-12)

**Superseded:** the woodland ground mask this section tunes was removed the same day; see
"The woodland ground mask is gone" above. Kept for the measurements and for why the
intermediate fixes did not work.


Reference photographs of the Kuopio region are in `imgs/reference`, with matched game
viewpoints in `imgs/reference/game`. `imgs/` is excluded through `.git/info/exclude`, so
nothing in it is tracked; `RENDER-03` still owns the question of where a durable set lives.
Crops were measured, not eyeballed.

**Hue, not value, made open ground look like a sports pitch.** Sunlit vegetation in the
photographs measures hue `59-79` degrees - yellow-green and olive - at luminance
`0.36-0.43`. The game's open ground measured luminance `0.434`, already inside that range,
but hue `109`. Every authored land green sat at hue `98-115`, which is blue-green, and at
that luminance blue-green reads as fluorescent. Two separate causes:

- `grass_material_layer` multiplied the grass photo's chroma by a fixed `3.00`. The photo
  is a muted yellow-green, mean RGB `(0.220, 0.294, 0.137)` at saturation `0.53`; the gain
  drove it to saturation `1.00` with the blue channel clamped to zero, three times over for
  the macro, mid and micro layers. It is now `terrain_grass_chroma_gain`, bound from
  `TERRAIN_GRASS_CHROMA_GAIN = 1.15`, so the photo contributes fibre and breakup, not hue.
- The authored entries in `terrain_surface_color` and `grass_meadow_variation` were rotated
  into the measured band, each keeping its original luminance and saturation. `dry_open`
  (hue `60`) and `dry_grass` (hue `71`) were already correct and are unchanged - the two
  colours that read as "dry" were the two that matched Finland.

Measured on matched `E13` `yaw000` crops of open foreground ground:

| Build | hue | sat | luminance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| shipped at `47ee891d` | `109` | `0.64` | `0.434` |
| chroma gain only | `95` | `0.55` | `0.415` |
| chroma gain and first rotation | `84` | `0.55` | `0.416` |
| shipped | `80` | `0.56` | `0.417` |
| reference photographs | `59-79` | `0.22-0.60` | `0.24-0.43` |

Luminance barely moves across the whole sequence, which is the point: the value was never
the error.

The foliage carried the same error and is corrected with it. `_leaf_color` and the
understory palette in `tree_species.gd` sat at hue `90-112` against `76-79` for sunlit
canopy in the photographs, so once the ground moved the trees read bluer than the ground
they stood on. Same treatment: rotate, keep luminance and saturation.

Forest floor under canopy now measures luminance `0.172` against `0.181` for shaded forest
mass in the Kuopio photograph, so the floor is not too dark despite looking it in a
screenshot. Its *hue* is still `105` against `73`, and that residue is not the palette:
`hillshade_shadow_tint` is `(0.82, 0.88, 0.90)`, a cool blue, so shaded green ground lands
blue-green. Changing it touches every shaded surface and the whole day cycle, so it is
left alone here.

**Contours were drawn in the plain world view.** `contour_minor_strength 0.14` and
`contour_major_strength 0.34` composited survey lines onto ordinary terrain colour at
`2.5 m` and `10 m` intervals. In an aerial view that is the strongest single cue that the
landscape is a topographic map, and no reference photograph has anything like it. They are
now gated on `overlay_mode > 0`, so the analysis overlays - which are read as a map - keep
them and the world view does not. Every interval and colour uniform is unchanged.

**The woodland mask darkened ground the scatter would never plant.** `woodland_field()` is a
pure function of world XZ, but `scatter_layer` also rejects a candidate for standing water,
for a road or building surface, and for relief across `clear_footprint`. The visible
consequence was lake beds: the terrain tint showed through the water, which clamps alpha at
`0.92` and samples scene colour for shallow refraction, so a darkened bed read as mud. The
mask is now multiplied down by watermap depth and by slope, both already available in the
fragment. Roads and buildings occlude the ground they own, so they need no gate here.

This is a narrow fix, not a complete one: it does not reproduce footprint clearance, density
or site exclusion, and a default or not-yet-resident water texture is not proof of dry
ground. The complete form is for Rust to publish a derived coverage tile per patch from the
accepted population, which is filed as `RENDER-05`. The Rust pin test now says explicitly
that only the *field* is mirrored and the gates must not be "restored" away.

Two further leaks the first version missed. `apply_natural_land_variation` was suppressed
under woodland, but `apply_grass_detail` runs after it and its `grass_detail_mask` excluded
only rock, cliff and shore - so `grass_material_layer` anchored the forest floor back toward
`grass_meadow_variation` and undid the darkening. It is now attenuated by the woodland mask
as well. And the floor colour itself sat at luminance `0.078`, dark enough to read as a
painted stain from the air rather than as shaded ground; it went to `0.100` with stronger
litter breakup here, which was still far too dark and is superseded by the section above.
The mask edge is broken up by noise at stand scale so a `2 km` sinusoid's boundary does not
read as an ellipse.

Scatter cost is unaffected: `yaw180` scatter isolated as `full - off` measured `+7.27 ms`
and `9.68 M` primitives against `+7.48 ms` and `9.7 M` for the shipped build, which is
inside run-to-run variation. All of the above is fragment arithmetic on paths that already
ran, and the contour gate removes work.

Still wrong, and now more visible because the ground moved: the foliage colours carry the
same hue error the ground did. `tree_species.gd` holds conifer needle at hue `112`,
broadleaf and bush core at `100`, birch leaf at `90`, against `76-79` for sunlit canopy in
the photographs. The trees now read bluer than the ground they stand on.

### The understory stopped being tents (2026-09-12)

`_bush()` built a plant `2.8-3.4 m` tall and `2.15-2.65 m` wide on a **five-segment
lathe**, so its silhouette was a pentagonal pyramid with facets big enough to read
individually - the "tent" - and it stood taller than a person while being called
undergrowth. Its core was `Color(0.072, 0.132, 0.042)`, luminance `0.11`, identical across
all six variants, with four foliage cards stuck around the outside of a solid cone.

The six variants are now a catalogue of boreal ground layer rather than six of one shrub:

| Variant | Form | Height | Triangles |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| 0, 1 | blueberry and lingonberry mats, cards only, no trunk or apex | `0.06-0.09 m` | `36`, `42` |
| 2 | grass tuft, eight bent tapered blades, two-sided | `0.34-0.65 m` | `48` |
| 3 | fern, three arching fronds with six leaflet pairs each | `0.45-0.60 m` | `48` |
| 4 | prostrate juniper, irregular outward sprays | `0.15-0.36 m` | `56` |
| 5 | spruce sapling, separated whorls on a `24 mm` stem | `1.6 m` | `64` |

Against a flat `64` triangles before, so the budget went down, not up, and the grass tuft
is the cheapest honest answer to there being no grass: a dedicated grass layer cannot use
this node layout at all, because visibility lives on one `MultiMeshInstance3D` per `510 m`
patch, so **any** range must exceed the `361 m` half-diagonal or plants vanish at the
camera's feet (`RENDER-02`).

Only the two woody forms carry both a stem surface and a card surface; a mat is cards alone
and a grass tuft is blades alone. Ground plants bend from their own base, so sway weight is
now proportional to height above ground rather than following a shared ring schedule.

`vegetation_appearance_test.gd` had encoded three assumptions this breaks, and each was
rewritten to state the new contract rather than relaxed: a bush had to have exactly two
surfaces, bush card sway had to span exactly `0.2-0.8`, and `max_height / min_height` had
to stay under `1.3` for every species. The last one is the interesting one - a `0.06 m`
blueberry mat and a `1.6 m` sapling are both ground layer, and forcing one height across
the variants is precisely what produced a field of identical `3 m` cones. Trees and rocks
still hold the proportion invariant, and every surface must still use one of the three
shared materials, because a new material is another draw call on the densest species in
the world.

Matched `E13`, one release binary, unprofiled, `yaw180` scatter isolated as `full - off`:
`+7.26 ms` and `9.52 M` primitives against `+7.48 ms` and `9.7 M` shipped. Slightly
cheaper, from the lower average triangle count.

### Birch, crown density and distant albedo (2026-09-12)

Broadleaf variants with `variant % 3 != 2` are birch: `0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10`.
The other four retain generic broadleaf foliage. Species and variant counts remain
`4` and `[12, 12, 6, 6]`. Birch uses near-white bark `(0.78, 0.76, 0.70)`, a dark root
flare, and eight narrow horizontal lenticels, each interrupted deterministically around
the trunk. Nineteen near trunk rings replace five; per-band vertex colours supply the
markings in the existing opaque surface, with no bark texture or extra material.
The mid trunk retains four rings and represents a basal scar/band and pale shaft.

Birch has a narrower, upright crown, fine brown outer twigs that turn downward, and
yellow-green leaves `(0.165, 0.265, 0.065)`. Its atlas cell contains small toothed ovate
leaves on seven hanging twigs, with transparent cell borders. Generic broadleaf and spruce
retain their palettes. Spruce primary roots now begin at 12% of tree height. Primary
counts increase from 10 to 16 for spruce and 8 to 12 for broadleaf; each still has two
children. Children attach at seeded positions in the outer 60–89% of their parent, taper
to 24% of parent radius for birch and 32% otherwise, and carry their clusters at the tips.
This gives 32/24 clusters instead of 20/16 without adding recursion. Cores and tree cards
retain sway weight `1`; bush weights and all shader contracts are unchanged.

Exact indexed lod-0 counts, summed over both surfaces **per tree**, against `a5a81e44`:

| Species / variants | Vertices before → after (delta) | Triangles before → after (delta) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Conifer 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 | 1805 → 2813 (+1008) | 645 → 1005 (+360) |
| Conifer 2 | 1805 → 2811 (+1006) | 645 → 1005 (+360) |
| Conifer 4, 8 | 1803 → 2813 (+1010) | 645 → 1005 (+360) |
| Broadleaf birch 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 | 1469 → 2561 (+1092) | 525 → 905 (+380) |
| Broadleaf generic 2 | 1469 → 2139 (+670) | 525 → 765 (+240) |
| Broadleaf generic 5, 8, 11 | 1469 → 2141 (+672) | 525 → 765 (+240) |
| Bush, all variants | 160 → 160 (0) | 64 → 64 (0) |
| Rock, all variants | 132 → 132 (0) | 48 → 48 (0) |

Every near variant remains below 2× its original vertices. Conifer mid vertices fall
296 → 290 and far vertices fall 81 → 77 (73 → 69 for variants 3, 5, 7); triangles remain
102/28. Broadleaf mid/far counts remain exactly 274 and 84/92 vertices, 96/32 triangles.
The far broadleaf profile retains its original geometry to preserve indexed vertex reuse;
the mid birch profile narrows. Mesh surface counts, materials and MultiMesh counts do not grow.

`build_meshes()` constructs all near variants first, then measures their actual stored
8-bit vertex RGB across both surfaces, including wood and foliage cores and cards.
For triangle `i`, `A_i = length((b-a) cross (c-a))/2` and
`C_i = (C_a + C_b + C_c)/3`; distant colour is `sum(A_i*C_i)/sum(A_i)` across all 12
variants of that species. Both distant levels use this mean without applying the old
additional face brightening. This represents the species mix because the distant scatter
uses variant zero for the entire population. Alpha remains sway weight and is excluded
from RGB arithmetic. The measured sums and means are:

| Species | Sum of area (m²) | Sum of area × RGB | Derived distant RGB |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Conifer | 7345.923828 | (408.690094, 895.270569, 308.559570) | (0.05563495, 0.12187311, 0.04200419) |
| Broadleaf mix | 11976.332031 | (1972.277100, 3151.504883, 933.372253) | (0.16468123, 0.26314440, 0.07793473) |

This is an emitted-area albedo match, not a prediction of screen luminance: it does not
model alpha-mask coverage, overlap, background, normals or backlighting. Actual patch-switch
brightness is unverified. The per-instance tint boundary is outside this change.
The new work is O(emitted triangles) once per catalogue, with bounded branch depth and
O(1) atlas selection per cluster; there is no new per-frame work.

Fresh CPU validation used Godot `4.7.1.stable.official.a13da4feb`, headless dummy rendering,
default worker settings and no affinity overrides. Baseline is `a5a81e44` with only the
same FIXTURE timing/count instrumentation added; after is this revision. The fixture times
`host.add_child(vegetation)`, whose `_ready()` builds the catalogue, excluding later checks
and patch uploads. Three separate process runs measured before **54.586, 56.501, 54.858 ms**
and after **90.944, 99.424, 94.523 ms**: medians **54.858 → 94.523 ms**, a **39.665 ms / 72.3%**
startup increase. These are unprofiled CPU measurements on the shared machine, not GPU
acceptance results. Additional geometry and the area integration increase startup cost.

Commands (full stdout/stderr under `/tmp/birch-validation/`):

```

Appearance prints `PASS vegetation appearance, shared material, LOD buckets, positions and
empty density`, with **0 SCRIPT ERROR** lines on all three before and after runs.
Invalidation exits **0**, with **0 SCRIPT ERROR** and **0 ERROR** lines; that harness has
no PASS print, so no PASS line is claimed for it. New targeted checks cover every geometry
budget, birch split/bark/cell/palette, analytic unequal-area integration and all distant
crown colours within one 8-bit quantization step. Existing shader, sway, placement and
population assertions remain. Position and appearance digests are unchanged.

Both final atlas bakes used Blender `5.2.1 LTS`, Cycles CPU, one render thread, seed 137,
32 samples, with existing mip coverage correction. To avoid a sandbox PulseAudio shutdown
hang after files were written, the validation invocation exits after the bake script returns:

```bash
blender --background -noaudio --python tools/bake_foliage_atlas.py --python-expr 'import sys, os; sys.stdout.flush(); sys.stderr.flush(); os._exit(0)' -- /tmp/birch-validation/bake-1/foliage_atlas.png
# Repeat with bake-2, then compare:
sha256sum /tmp/birch-validation/bake-{1,2}/foliage_atlas.png
```

Both PNGs hash to `15e7fa5d263076c0258e8abbee37f0b0b3a1a40391f0092b27eca5905202d990`;
DDS and coverage JSON are also byte-identical across the two bakes. The headless import
completed and retained unchanged `.png.import`/`.dds.uid` companions. Its editor socket
cannot listen inside the sandbox; this did not prevent texture import. An explicit log
path was needed because Godot crashes when its default user log cannot be written here.
No game window, GPU benchmark or shader change was part of this validation.

## Purpose

This document owns world extent, terrain storage, water storage, and the deterministic
implementation path from the current chunk-aware runtime to a real large-world authoring pipeline.

It answers questions like:

- what `WorldConfig` means today
- what terrain and water state is authoritative
- when dense buffers are still allowed
- how terrain and water render/upload boundaries must stay local as world size or terrain density
  increases
- what is already implemented
- what the next deterministic implementation slices must do

It does not own zoning legality, building placement rules, or multi-tier inactive-region
simulation behavior. Those remain owned by their respective docs.

## Document Conventions

Interpretation rules:

- Sections under `Implemented Runtime Contract` describe the live code unless explicitly marked as a
  compatibility gap.
- Sections under `Implemented Editor / Rendering Slices` describe shipped editor, renderer, and
  authored-world behavior.
- Sections under `Remaining Planned Deterministic Implementation` are intended next steps, not
  shipped behavior.
- `must` means required for the owning contract.
- `should` means intended unless a better measured implementation replaces it.
- `may` means allowed but optional.

Terminology:

- `world extent`: the authored width and height of the map
- `runtime terrain cell`: one live terrain sample in the current in-memory terrain grid
- `authored terrain chunk`: the canonical chunk span described by `WorldConfig`
- `source terrain`: the authoritative player- or importer-authored terrain surface
- `visual terrain`: the derived terrain surface after engineered-ground earthworks
- `WorldDefinition`: the reusable authored-world asset for blank-world v1

## Implemented Runtime Contract

### 1. `WorldConfig` Is The Authoritative World Metadata

The live runtime now uses `WorldConfig` instead of the old `MapConfig`.

```rust
pub struct WorldConfig {
    pub width_m: f32,
    pub height_m: f32,
    pub terrain_cell_m: f32,
    pub terrain_chunk_m: f32,
    pub terrain_base_elevation_m: f32,
    pub env_cell_m: f32,
    pub zone_cell_m: f32,
}
```

Current defaults:

- fallback gameplay world: `20_000 m × 20_000 m`
- editor sandbox: `500 m × 500 m`
- default terrain sample cell: `10 m`
- canonical terrain chunk span: `512 m`
- default base terrain elevation: `0.0`
- default environmental cell: `40 m`
- default zoning cell: `10 m`

Current deterministic rules:

- `WorldConfig` is saved and loaded as part of every city save.
- City saves, world definitions and blank-world creation validate the same metadata before
  allocating world storage. Invalid spacing is rejected rather than clamped. Terrain spacing
  must meet the runtime minimum; terrain/environment/chunk dimensions must fit signed grid
  coordinates and dense-buffer allocation layouts. Environmental grids must contain at least
  one cell per axis. These structural checks do not impose a fixed world-size or RAM budget.
- old save migration is intentionally not required; version mismatch is a hard rejection.
- authored terrain chunk count is:
  - `terrain_chunk_columns = ceil(width_m / terrain_chunk_m)`
  - `terrain_chunk_rows = ceil(height_m / terrain_chunk_m)`

### 2. Terrain And Water Grid Sizing Is Now Explicit

Current deterministic rule:

- `terrain_cell_m` is an explicit `WorldConfig` field
- `terrain.width = terrain_grid_width()`
- `terrain.height = terrain_grid_height()`
- `water.width = terrain_grid_width()`
- `water.height = terrain_grid_height()`
- `terrain_grid_width = round(width_m / terrain_cell_m) + 1`
- `terrain_grid_height = round(height_m / terrain_cell_m) + 1`
- runtime sparse chunk span in cells comes from `WorldConfig.terrain_storage_chunk_cells()`:
  - `max(1, ceil(terrain_chunk_m / terrain_cell_m))` (shared by terrain, water and deposits)

Implication:

- terrain sample density is now configurable independently from zoning density
- runtime world-space XZ is now canonical metres
- terrain, zoning, and environment each use their own cell spacing explicitly

Environmental pollution and noise keep their existing `DataGrid<f32>` buffers. The daily order
is pollution, noise, then desirability. Their shared four-neighbor diffusion kernel preserves
left/right/up/down summation order and adds today's emissions before the existing 0–100 limit.
Pollution retains own/neighbor weights `0.60/0.40` and retention `0.995`; noise uses `0.50/0.50`
and `0.90`. The kernel expands separately for each field so Rayon receives constant coefficients.
Desirability reads the two resulting fields; it has no zoning dependency.

Environmental bilinear sampling clamps to the edge and interpolates along the remaining axis
for single-row/column grids; a single cell stays constant and an empty grid returns zero
(`AUDIT-01-G3`). Five CPU-0 matched release pairs (24 configured Rayon workers; sampling itself
is serial) measure 1,048,576 queries per sample, 11 samples per process:
1 × 1 costs 5.671 → 1.059 ms; 1 × 512 costs 5.672 → 2.798 ms; 512 × 1 costs
5.769 → 2.711 ms; 512 × 512 costs 6.548 → 6.165 ms. The ordinary 2D interpolation
path is unchanged. Command: the recorded release test binary with
`--exact simulation::grid::data_grid::tests::benchmark_bilinear_grid_sampling --ignored --nocapture`.
Identities and raw results are under `/tmp/metrum-full-audit/grid-sampling-*`. This isolates
sampling arithmetic and does not measure whole-overlay rasterization or GPU upload.

Environmental RGBA pixels sample their world-space texture centres through
`WorldConfig.world_to_env_grid`, so rounded source-grid dimensions cannot stretch cell spacing
(`AUDIT-01-G4`). Texture UVs cover the actual terrain-render extent, which can differ from the
authored world dimensions after terrain-sample rounding; environmental coordinates retain the
authored origin and spacing. The bridge uses the same terrain extent as the published shader
snapshot (`AUDIT-01-G4` follow-up). The bridge retains terrain-sized images, existing colors, the 0.01 transparent
threshold and the 0–200 alpha scale for 0–100 field values. All three getters share dimensions
and image conversion. Raster rows use Rayon; column coordinates are calculated once and reused.
Work is O(W×H), with one RGBA output and O(W) temporary coordinates, no per-pixel allocation or
persistent duplicate state. The small O(W) setup stays serial to avoid a second parallel dispatch.

Five matched unprofiled release process pairs on eight physical P cores
(`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=8`, affinity `0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14`) measure complete CPU raster generation,
including allocations and destruction:

| Image | Before (ms) | Corrected (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 129 × 129 | 0.113324 | 0.027582 |
| 1025 × 1025 | 7.056572 | 1.030466 |
| 2001 × 2001 | 26.893081 | 3.880396 |

Three CPU-0 single-worker pairs cost 0.113 → 0.125 ms, 7.065 → 7.336 ms, and
26.941 → 27.957 ms, respectively: about 4% additional large-image cost for correct world mapping.
The first corrected version recomputed column coordinates in every row and cost about 24% extra;
that version is retained only as a measured intermediate (`overlay-raster-matched-bench.json`).
Column reuse preserves its exact result bytes across 1/8/24 workers. Three mixed-core 24-worker
pairs also improve the larger workloads, but physical-core comparisons above are the primary evidence.

Command: the recorded release test binary with
`--exact nodes::sim::render::zoning::tests::benchmark_environmental_overlay_raster --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1`.
The deterministic source fields include zero/negative, intermediate and saturated values;
three warmups precede 21 samples of four rasterizations each. No world-constructor work is timed.
Identities/source snapshots are `overlay-raster-{before,columns}-*`, and raw results are
`/tmp/metrum-full-audit/overlay-columns-matched-bench.json`. Corrected alignment intentionally
changes old pixels; checksums match within each build across all repetitions/worker counts.
This CPU test excludes the Godot array bridge and GPU texture upload.

The later explicit-terrain-extent correction retains comparable raster cost: five eight-core
pairs measure 0.0281 → 0.0278, 1.0288 → 1.0305 and 3.8871 → 3.8820 ms; three CPU-0
single-worker pairs remain comparable as well. Aligned-world bytes match exactly; the added
45 × 35 m authored / 50 × 40 m rendered fixture verifies the intentionally corrected case.
Build identities and raw rows are in `/tmp/metrum-full-audit/extraction-{before,final}-identity.json`
and `extraction-matched-bench.json`; the raster baseline is `overlay-raster-columns-tests`.

Deposit sampling, mine attachment and field/pit rendering share their exact f32 ray-crossing
predicate (`AUDIT-01-G6`). Separate boundary-inclusive and higher-precision road predicates retain
their own contracts. Five CPU-0 release pairs of the ignored
`nodes::sim::render::resources::tests::benchmark_work_area_polygon_queries` benchmark cost
1.400 → 1.417 / 3.970 → 4.038 / 14.416 → 15.358 ms for 262,144 queries against
4 / 16 / 64 vertices, respectively. This records a 1.2–6.5% measured cost for sharing, not a
speedup. Outputs match exactly; work remains O(vertices), allocation-free per query. Three warmups
precede 21 samples; polygon construction and weighted output checksums are outside timing.
The same extraction identity/result artifacts retain source, binary hashes, commands and rows.

Five further alternating headless Godot process pairs measure the actual three image getters,
including the core lock, raster allocation and Godot byte-array copy. They use the same eight
physical cores, blank worlds, three warmups and nine measured calls per getter; world creation,
payload validation and hashing are outside timing. Per-getter process medians:

| Image | Pollution before → after (ms) | Noise before → after (ms) | Desirability before → after (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 129 × 129 | 0.101 → 0.051 | 0.101 → 0.030 | 0.101 → 0.026 |
| 1025 × 1025 | 6.372 → 1.187 | 6.376 → 1.157 | 6.533 → 1.171 |
| 2001 × 2001 | 25.574 → 5.821 | 25.470 → 5.873 | 25.447 → 5.710 |

All blank RGBA bytes/checksums match. This is CPU bridge acceptance; GPU upload and full gameplay
frame cost remain outside the timing. Command/script and raw rows are preserved under
`/tmp/metrum-full-audit/overlay-raster-bridge-benchmark.gd` and
`overlay-bridge-matched-bench.json`; extension identities are in the corresponding
`overlay-raster-{before,columns}-identity.json` files. The initial harness used an unavailable
`PackedByteArray.hash()` member; it was corrected to Godot's `hash()` before any matched timing.

`AUDIT-01-G2` preserves O(C) diffusion work and existing row parallelism, with no per-cell
allocation or new grid state. Five matched unprofiled release pairs on eight physical P cores
(`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=8`, affinity `0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14`) measure combined pollution/noise passes:

| Grid per field | Before (ms) | After (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 32 × 32 | 0.014645 | 0.014453 |
| 256 × 256 | 0.111181 | 0.113025 |
| 512 × 512 | 0.303329 | 0.298051 |

Command: the recorded release test binary with
`--exact simulation::grid::tests::benchmark_environmental_diffusion --ignored --nocapture`.
Each sample resets deterministic source fields outside timing and measures eight paired ticks;
25 samples produce each process median. Empty building/road collections isolate diffusion,
excluding emission scaling and world construction. All output-bit checksums match across builds
and 1/8/24 workers. CPU-0 single-worker timings also remain comparable; 24-worker timings on
mixed core types are noisy. Exact identities and raw results are in
`/tmp/metrum-full-audit/environment-{before,zipped}-identity.json`,
`environment-zipped-matched-bench.json` and `environment-physical-matched-bench.json`.

The terrain shader blends environmental colors with their encoded alpha (`alpha × 0.6`) and
clamps overlay sampling at the world edge (`AUDIT-01-G5`). Previously every nonzero value used
the same blend, and the default sampler wrapped the opposite edge into the border. The
constant-zero baked-normal blend control/varying and constant grass-visibility aliases are
removed; height-derived normals and existing active material settings remain authoritative.

An actual OpenGL compatibility render regression (`terrain_overlay_shader_test.gd`) checks
increasing intensity in all three environmental modes and both texture edges. The old shader
fails six intensity and two edge assertions. The corrected shader passes; 44 reference images
covering normal, terrain-debug and grass-debug views of baked/unbaked sloped fixtures match
exactly after cleanup. This is rendered-pixel verification, rather than headless shader parsing.

Five matched unprofiled software-renderer process pairs use Godot 4.7.2, Mesa 26.2.2 llvmpipe,
`LP_NUM_THREADS=8`, and CPU affinity `0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14`. Three warmups precede 21 samples per
viewport/mode; timing includes frame synchronization, rendering and image readback:

| Viewport | Overlay | Before (ms) | After (ms) |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| 128 × 128 | Off | 0.891 | 0.887 |
| 128 × 128 | Pollution | 0.890 | 0.866 |
| 512 × 512 | Off | 4.661 | 4.756 |
| 512 × 512 | Pollution | 4.730 | 4.812 |

These timings are comparable, not a hardware-GPU or gameplay speedup claim. Work remains
O(pixels); alpha adds one scalar multiply and cleanup removes unused shader state. Output is
repeatable within each build, and inactive-overlay controls match across builds. Exact shader
identities, raw timings and image comparison results are under
`/tmp/metrum-full-audit/terrain-shader-{before,after}-identity.json`,
`terrain-shader-matched-bench.json`, and `terrain-shader-reference-comparison.json`.
`terrain-shader-benchmark.gd` and `match_terrain_shader.py` preserve the workload/commands.
The sandbox denied Xvfb's local listening socket; rendered checks ran with that restriction
lifted. No display/network service is needed by the simulation tests.

### 3. Terrain Uses Dual Sparse Buffers

The live `TerrainSystem` owns two sparse chunk-backed grids:

- `source terrain`: authoritative sculpted terrain
- `visual terrain`: derived terrain after engineered-ground earthworks

Current deterministic rules:

- untouched sparse terrain cells are implicit and read back as the configured base elevation
- setting terrain directly writes both source and visual buffers
- sculpting writes both source and visual buffers
- `reset_visuals_from_source()` discards the current visual terrain and clones the authoritative
  source terrain into it
- save/load persists the authoritative source terrain only
- renderer uploads use the visual terrain
- procedural hillshade is a render-only derivation generated from the uploaded visual terrain
  heightmap
- procedural hillshade must never become authored world data or save-game data
- terrain sculpting, DEM import, world load, and road-earthwork visual refreshes must all update
  hillshade automatically because it derives from the same visual terrain upload

### 4. Surface Queries Distinguish Source Terrain From Visible World Surface

Terrain-only height queries are authoritative against the source terrain surface, not the
engineered-ground-derived visual terrain. Separate world-surface queries read the current
engineered-ground client surface first and fall back to visual terrain only when no client-owned
surface owns the queried location.

Current deterministic rules:

- `get_height(x, y)` reads source terrain
- `sample_height_world(x, z)` reads source terrain
- `intersect_terrain()` and terrain height queries use source terrain interpolation in world space
- `get_world_surface_height()` returns visible client-owned surface height when an engineered-ground
  client owns the queried XZ location, otherwise visual terrain height
- `intersect_world_surface()` raycasts the visible client-owned surface first and falls back to
  visual terrain when no client-owned triangle is hit
- engineered-ground earthworks are a visual derivation, not an edit to source terrain

Editor interaction rule:

- authored-ground editing tools must use the terrain-only query family
- visible-surface placement, inspection, and selection tools must use the visible-world query
  family
- terrain-authoring tools must not implicitly move already placed engineered-ground client surfaces

This preserves the rule that engineered-ground placement must not feed back into the terrain that
grade and slope calculations treat as authored ground.

### 5. Terrain Height Storage Is Scaled At Query / Render Boundaries

The live runtime stores raw terrain sample values and multiplies them by `HEIGHT_SCALE` when
converting to world-space `y`.

Current deterministic rule:

- `world_y = terrain_sample * HEIGHT_SCALE`
- `HEIGHT_SCALE = 20.0`

This means the live terrain buffer is not currently a direct world-space metre heightfield.

Important note:

- `terrain_base_elevation_m` is currently forwarded into the raw terrain sample storage before
  `HEIGHT_SCALE` is applied
- the `_m` suffix is therefore ahead of the current implementation and should not be treated as a
  proof that the live terrain buffer already stores fully world-space metres

### 6. Terrain Coordinates Are Centered At World Origin

The live terrain surface is centered around `(0, 0)` in world XZ space.

Current deterministic rules:

- terrain local grid coordinates span `0..width-1` and `0..height-1`
- world-space XZ is centered by:
  - `half_w = ((width - 1) * terrain_cell_m) * 0.5`
  - `half_h = ((height - 1) * terrain_cell_m) * 0.5`
- world-to-grid conversion for terrain queries uses that centered origin convention
- terrain samples sit on world-edge coordinates
- zoning and environmental cells remain centre-aligned metre cells

### 7. Sparse Chunk Storage Is Authoritative At Rest

Terrain and water now use sparse chunk-backed storage internally.

Current deterministic rules:

- a sparse chunk is allocated only when at least one cell in that chunk differs from the default
  value
- resetting a cell back to the default value may cause its chunk to be removed if the whole chunk
  becomes default again
- random cell `get` / `set` is expected-average `O(1)` against the chunk map
- dense materialization is `O(width × height)` and must remain a boundary-only operation

Allowed dense boundaries today:

- save/load
- renderer upload to Godot
- temporary compatibility scratch buffers inside water ticking
- undo snapshots

Dense restoration scans independent storage chunks with Rayon and only allocates payloads for
chunks containing a non-default cell (`AUDIT-01-G7`). It retains O(width × height) work and the
existing sparse map, with O(materialized chunks) temporary collection entries and no per-cell
allocation. Sixteen-chunk minimum work units avoid dispatching small grids. Default-only chunks
have no payload allocation; partial edge padding and copy-on-write snapshots retain their contracts.

Five alternating, unprofiled release process pairs on eight physical P cores
(`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=8`, affinity `0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14`) measure repeated dense replacement with
52-cell chunks, the default 512 m / 10 m storage layout:

| Grid | Blank before → after (ms) | Sparse before → after (ms) | Full before → after (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 129 × 129 | 0.00833 → 0.00713 | 0.00852 → 0.00746 | 0.00272 → 0.00286 |
| 1025 × 1025 | 0.50869 → 0.06358 | 0.52016 → 0.06455 | 0.20430 → 0.05371 |
| 2001 × 2001 | 1.93417 → 0.22558 | 1.97056 → 0.23241 | 0.97296 → 0.33166 |

Three CPU-0 single-worker pairs improve blank/sparse cases by roughly 10–16%; full cases cost
0.00279 → 0.00288, 0.20644 → 0.21799 and 0.95955 → 0.99002 ms. Those small full-grid
costs are retained explicitly. The first four-chunk batch had roughly 4–7 µs excess small-grid
overhead; it is a measured intermediate, not the accepted implementation.

Command: preserved release test binary with
`--exact simulation::core::sparse_chunk_grid::tests::benchmark_sparse_dense_replacement --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1`.
Three warmups precede 21 samples of eight replacements, including old-chunk destruction and
allocation. Input setup, dense reconstruction and weighted-bit checksums are outside timing.
Sparse fixtures fill the final cell of every sixty-fourth chunk; all output checksums and chunk
counts match across builds and worker counts. Identities/source snapshots are
`/tmp/metrum-full-audit/sparse-load-{before,final}-*`; raw rows are `sparse-grain-matched-bench.json`.
This isolates sparse reconstruction, excluding SQLite decoding, water filling and renderer upload.

### 8. Engineered Ground Is A Chunk-Local Visual Derivation Step

Shared engineered-ground semantics now live in [`earthworks.md`](earthworks.md). This document owns
the terrain-storage side of that boundary: source terrain stays authored ground, visual terrain is
the derived buffer, and only touched chunks are reset and restamped.

Current deterministic sequence:

1. compile or refresh the affected engineered-ground client surface inputs
2. prepare structural support writes for the touched visual terrain chunks
3. in canonical chunk order, reset each touched chunk from source terrain and apply its support
   writes before advancing to the next chunk (shared borders preserve this ordering)
4. leave untouched visual chunks and all source terrain chunks unchanged
5. rebuild dependent caches against the updated client state plus visual terrain

Current runtime client state:

- roads are the first live engineered-ground client
- grounded roads no longer stamp ordinary `Standard` footprints or margins into visual terrain;
  road-touched terrain patches receive stitched mesh topology from Rust
- grounded road-owned asphalt, shoulder / curb, and sidewalk footprints also provide exact clip
  polygons to terrain and water render patches so neither terrain nor water remains a visible carrier
  under the committed road footprint
- grounded roads use Rust-generated stitched terrain patch topology from the clipped footprint edge
  to nearby terrain, so ordinary `Standard` roads do not need a visible closure strip
- terrain-only queries still read source terrain, while visible-world queries use the client-owned
  surface first, structural local earthwork geometry second, and visual terrain third; ordinary
  grounded seams are terrain topology, not a separate road-owned query surface
- flat building/yard pads and graded edge paving use the same Rust-side stitched terrain patch model for local site
  tie-ins; future engineered-ground clients should extend [`earthworks.md`](earthworks.md) instead
  of inventing a separate terrain-flattening path

Current deterministic editor rule:

- terrain authoring edits source terrain first
- after the source edit, touched engineered-ground clients rebuild derived terrain outputs; ordinary
  grounded roads regenerate CDT terrain patch meshes while structural clients may restamp visual
  terrain
- terrain brushes do not directly sculpt roadbeds, flat pads, or future local earthwork geometry

Remaining limitation:

- the fixed Kuopio workload passes 39 placements / 158 profile checks, shared-side and coverage
  regressions, and saved-reference settlement; broader authored-map coverage remains ongoing,
  not a claim of watertightness for arbitrary inputs (see `ROAD-24` in [`roads.md`](roads.md))
- terrain density alone is no longer the target fix for road / terrain gaps
- the live road-touched seam path is the Spade CDT patch builder described in
  [`roads.md`](roads.md):
  road footprint loops become hard constraints, terrain faces inside those loops are omitted, and
  road seam constraint edges are preserved exactly
- current grounded-road terrain editing must keep placed `Standard` road geometry fixed and rebuild
  derived terrain outputs around the committed roadbed instead of silently resynchronizing the road
  to later source-terrain edits

Authoritative rule:

- engineered-ground earthworks change the visual terrain only
- source terrain remains the authored ground surface

### 9. Water Uses Sparse Baseline-Depth Storage

The live `WaterSystem` stores one sparse chunk-backed layer:

- `baseline depth`

Current deterministic rules:

- untouched water cells are implicitly dry
- `Lake Fill` and `Open Water` rebuild baseline depth from authored still-water records
- water save/load persists one dense row-major baseline-depth snapshot at the serialization boundary
- no source/sink, velocity, or flux state exists in the shipped runtime

Water diagnostics compare cached upload bytes with the current authored baseline (`AUDIT-01-W1`).
The retired `depth_data` array fallback and duplicate baseline/visible source-statistics fields are
removed. Cached min/max/count/sum decode the actual native f32 payload; they no longer report a
filled patch as all-zero. Decoding occurs only for explicitly requested diagnostics, with O(patch
samples) temporary data, and does not add work to regular texture uploads. The headless
`surface_patch_debug_test.gd` regression exercises an actual authored fill, asynchronous native
payload, live source statistics and formatted diagnostic output, alongside regular/refined terrain
payloads with negative heights.

Three CPU-0 headless helper runs compare the existing calculation on a prepared float array with
native-byte decoding plus that same calculation: 7 × 7 samples cost 0.00309 → 0.00341 ms,
55 × 55 cost 0.16156 → 0.16113 ms, and 515 × 515 cost 14.382 → 14.121 ms. Outputs match.
This isolates diagnostic decoding overhead; it does **not** compare with the old production
reader that incorrectly returned zero. Three warmups precede 21 samples, with 128 / 16 / 1
repetitions respectively; setup is excluded. Command/script, renderer identity and raw results
are under `/tmp/metrum-full-audit/water-stats-benchmark.gd`, `water-stats-final-identity.json`
and `water-stats-benchmark.json`. These timings do not cover full diagnostic formatting or frames.

Terrain, including refined and road-preview patches, exports a single native `height_bytes` buffer
(`AUDIT-01-G8`). The retired parallel `height_data` export and frontend fallback are removed;
failed refinement payloads still omit drawable heights intentionally. Terrain and water share
`render_debug.gd` for count/min/max/sum with the same 0.001 visibility threshold and summation
order. This is stateless, explicitly requested diagnostic work, not simulation state.

Three CPU-0 headless comparisons against the retained previous water reader give 7 × 7 / 55 × 55 /
515 × 515 diagnostic costs of 0.00337 → 0.00307 / 0.15981 → 0.14063 / 13.985 → 12.381 ms.
Both sides decode the same byte payload and produce equal statistics; eliminating the redundant
per-value conversion is included. Setup is excluded; three warmups precede 21 measured samples.
Scripts, before/after renderer identities and raw rows are `/tmp/metrum-full-audit/surface-stats-benchmark.gd`,
`surface-payload-{before,after}-identity.json` and `surface-stats-benchmark.json`.

Five alternating native bridge process pairs on eight physical P cores measure completed
asynchronous payload requests for blank nonzero terrain, with regular and refined paths:

| Authored patch span | Regular before → after (ms) | Refined before → after (ms) | Removed duplicate height bytes per refined payload |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 40 m | 0.07075 → 0.07050 | 0.07525 → 0.07488 | 676 |
| 512 m | 0.08263 → 0.08063 | 0.09963 → 0.09850 | 14,400 |
| 1024 m | 0.09975 → 0.10025 | 0.11225 → 0.12125 | 49,284 |

This records comparable default-patch latency and a 9 µs larger refined median for the largest
fixture; there is no general latency-speedup claim. Largest refined process ranges overlap
(0.0831–0.1238 ms before, 0.1125–0.1305 ms after). Measurements include request/poll scheduling,
with 10 µs sleeps between empty polls, native export and completed return; cold world creation and
first refinement are excluded. Only completed payloads count, and explicit generation retries are
honored. Three warmups precede 21 samples of eight requests. All canonical render dictionaries
have equal checksums after excluding the removed duplicate array; raw height bytes, metadata and
mesh products are unchanged. Work remains O(payload samples/mesh size), with one fewer height
buffer and bulk byte copies. The benchmark changes no road-planning algorithm.

Command: `taskset -c 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14 godot --headless --path godot --script
/tmp/metrum-full-audit/surface-payload-benchmark.gd`, `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=8`.
Raw commands, rows and extension identities are `surface-payload-matched-bench.json` and
`surface-payload-{before,after}-identity.json`. This excludes texture upload and full gameplay frames.

Geometry diagnostics also share clip aggregation, signed polygon area, bounds formatting and mesh
labels (`AUDIT-01-G9`). The clip result is built once from the decoded groups; it no longer validates
the same packed loops twice or initializes a duplicate statistics dictionary. Mesh labels read
`ArrayMesh.surface_get_array_len()` instead of requesting all vertex attributes. This leaves
O(surface count) work for mesh labels and O(decoded clip points/groups) work for clip diagnostics.
No persistent cache or simulation state is added.

Three CPU-0 headless before/after helper runs preserve every result. Single-surface mesh labels
cost 0.00128 → 0.00093 ms at three vertices, 0.00300 → 0.00094 ms at 3,072 vertices and
0.07450 → 0.00100 ms at 98,304 vertices. Clip diagnostics with one hole per outer loop cost
0.01027 → 0.00873 / 0.21669 → 0.21094 / 1.748 → 1.708 ms at 1 / 32 / 256 groups.
Three warmups precede 21 samples; fixture/mesh construction is excluded and output checksums match.
The existing surface regression also verifies multiple surfaces, primitive/null meshes, hole area,
negative-coordinate bounds and actual native payload logs. Commands, source identities and raw rows
are `/tmp/metrum-full-audit/render-geometry-benchmark.gd`, `render-geometry-{before,after}-identity.json`
and `render-geometry-benchmark.json`. These are explicit diagnostic costs, not gameplay frame timings.

### 10. Live Water Runtime Is Baseline Still Water Only

The live repository intentionally keeps only deterministic authored still water.

Current repository state:

- `Lake Fill` and `Open Water` rebuild into a baseline-water layer
- baseline water stores flat still-water depth above terrain
- procedural waves are shader-only visual motion and do not imply runtime velocity
- future rivers or flowing water must be a new design, not a continuation of the removed dense
  source/sink solver

### 11. Save / Load Remains Dense At The Serialization Boundary

Sparse runtime storage does not change the save format boundary yet.

Current deterministic rules:

- terrain source data is serialized as one dense row-major `f32` blob
- water baseline depth is serialized as one dense row-major `f32` blob
- sparse chunk topology is not currently saved as chunk records
- loading reconstructs sparse storage from those dense blobs
- road loading compiles saved geometry first, locally finalizes only rejected grounded junctions,
  and rejects an unrenderable detached graph; it does not regrade all saved roads to source terrain

This is acceptable while city saves remain runtime snapshots rather than reusable authored world
assets.

### 12. Blank-World `WorldDefinition` Exists As A Separate Asset

The live runtime now has a separate authored-world asset path for blank worlds.

Current deterministic rules:

- `WorldDefinition` is stored as a single-file SQLite asset with its own schema version
- one `world_definition_meta` row stores:
  - world name
  - `WorldConfig` values needed to instantiate the world
- authored terrain is stored as zero or more `world_terrain_chunks` rows
- terrain chunk rows are keyed by zero-based `(chunk_x, chunk_z)` from the world minimum corner
- each chunk payload is one dense row-major `f32` source-terrain block
- only chunks containing at least one non-base terrain sample are persisted
- authored resource deposits are stored as zero or more `world_resource_deposit_chunks` rows
- resource deposit chunks are terrain-aligned `u16` richness grids keyed by `resource_id`,
  starting with `coal`
- loading a `WorldDefinition` resets runtime state to a fresh blank city on that world
- City load and blank-world reset share transient cleanup, including terrain brush state,
  render ownership, undo history, diagnostics and camera culling bounds. The final network-render
  invalidation advances the global terrain payload generation; an extra pre-publication bump
  is not needed. New Game retains the loaded asset registry by ownership transfer.
  Audit `AUDIT-01-AS4`: five alternating unprofiled release process pairs, pinned to CPU 0,
  `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=24`, three warmups then 11 samples of five resets. The fixture has no agents,
  buildings or roads; every measured replacement creates the same flat 256 m square world
  with 8 m samples and retains 128 / 4,096 registered assets. Registration and the initial test
  world are outside timing. Median reset time is `0.056421 / 1.804271 → 0.002045 / 0.002033 ms`.
  This isolates Rust world replacement and catalog retention, excluding file I/O and rendering.
  Command: `nodes::sim::core::tests::benchmark_blank_world_reset_with_assets --exact --ignored --nocapture`
  on matched release executables. Raw rows and source/executable identities are in
  `/tmp/metrum-full-audit/world-reset-matched-bench.json` and `world-reset-{before,after}-identity.json`.
- world replacement clears derived terrain ownership, caches and asynchronous render requests;
  its global terrain payload generation advances so old-world payloads and acknowledgements
  cannot match an unchanged patch key in the new world
- the current `WorldDefinition` format stores:
  - world metadata
  - terrain config
  - source terrain chunks
  - authored water records
  - authored coal deposit chunks
- the current `WorldDefinition` format does not store:
  - roads
  - zoning paint
  - water runtime state
  - agents
  - households
  - treasury history
  - derived visual terrain

Authoritative rule:

- city saves and `WorldDefinition` are separate persistence products with different ownership
- both writers share temporary-file publication: commit and close the replacement database
  before atomically renaming it over the destination; failed saves preserve the previous file

### 13. Godot Bridge Uses Patch Snapshots For Terrain / Water Rendering

The live Godot render bridge now consumes chunk-local terrain / water patch snapshots instead of
whole-map render buffers.

Current deterministic rules:

- `terrain.gd` consumes `get_terrain_patch_layout()`, generation-tagged dirty patch states,
  `request_terrain_patch_payloads()`, `poll_ready_terrain_patch_payloads()`,
  `acknowledge_terrain_patches()`, and `get_terrain_border_loop()`
- `water.gd` consumes generation-tagged dirty patch states, `request_water_patch_payloads()`,
  `poll_ready_water_patch_payloads()`, `acknowledge_water_patches()`, and
  `get_water_border_depths()`
- dirty acknowledgements clear only the exact uploaded patch/network revision; a mutation between
  upload and acknowledgement remains dirty, and live terrain brush steps advance touched patch
  revisions before their asynchronous payloads are requested
- world replacement explicitly rebuilds renderer residency. Dirty flags reflect actual patch
  ledgers: a new flat world with empty ledgers must not wait for nonexistent acknowledgements.
  Residency/payload queues still gate renderer readiness.
- renderer polling, ownership lookup, layout/border reads, and road-mesh retrieval consume immutable
  render snapshots or nonblocking job queues rather than waiting on the simulation mutex
- terrain material shoreline/depth sampling reuses the Water renderer's resident patch depth
  texture binding; it must not request a second terrain-aligned water snapshot or duplicate
  `ImageTexture` upload from GDScript
- terrain and water patch snapshots expose texture-ready `PackedByteArray` height/depth payloads
  so Godot image uploads do not convert `PackedFloat32Array` data on the render path
- the terrain shader keeps separate terrain-height and water-depth UV layouts because terrain and
  water patch textures may use different border widths
- terrain and water now keep patch identity stable while choosing a deterministic mesh-detail tier
  per resident patch from camera distance, so zoomed-out views do not pay near-field vertex
  density for every resident patch
- road-touched terrain patches switch from cached rectangular `PlaneMesh` topology to
  Rust-generated baked local `ArrayMesh` topology
- visible water patches always build depth-owned local `ArrayMesh` topology; dry cells emit no water
  mesh instead of relying on shader discard, and road-touched water patches suppress every water
  cell touched by the road footprint after a network edit instead of emitting partial transparent
  clip fragments
- water patch mesh topology is generated through async Rust/Rayon cache jobs by patch, LOD,
  road-clip signature, and depth signature; Godot submits requests in small time-capped batches,
  Rust owns the ready queue, and Godot polls completed mesh buffers without rebuilding pending-key
  request lists every frame
- the water mesh queue exports request/cache/job/ready/stale perf counters and compacts stale queued
  patch keys before submission when the queue grows beyond the deduped request set
- water mesh uploads apply under a measured per-frame time budget with pending-job backpressure,
  estimated payload-byte limits, and pending-job backpressure; Godot rejects stale ready meshes
  whose road/depth signatures no longer match the current resident patch before `ArrayMesh` upload
- fully wet unclipped water patches use indexed grid mesh buffers instead of expanded per-cell
  triangles so large still-water interiors upload less duplicate vertex data, and Godot reuses
  shared `ArrayMesh` resources for matching full-grid LOD/topology/size variants; regular
  full-grid variants are prewarmed during renderer load so the first matching lake patch can hit
  the cache instead of creating the mesh on the visible apply path
- regular rectangular terrain `PlaneMesh` variants are prewarmed from the active world layout so
  ordinary LOD changes assign cached meshes instead of constructing predictable resources mid-frame
- terrain and water patch `MeshInstance3D`, `ShaderMaterial`, `Image`, and `ImageTexture`
  resources are pooled and prewarmed before first visible residency activation, keeping cold
  resource construction out of the first streaming frames where possible
- perf summaries include viewport size, draw calls, rendered objects/primitives, video/texture/
  buffer memory, vsync mode, the `Engine.max_fps` cap, and terrain/water resource-pool counters
  before deeper renderer architecture work
- the old whole-map terrain / water Godot render APIs were removed from the steady terrain / water
  bridge
- dense terrain or water materialization may still exist at save/load, undo, or other explicit
  compatibility boundaries, but it is no longer the gameplay or WorldEditor terrain / water render
  path

This is a rendering boundary, not an excuse for simulation systems to depend on dense storage.

### 14. Terrain, Site Ground, Water, And Lighting Materials Are Runtime Presentation

Terrain, water, and building-site ground materials are Godot-side presentation contracts over
Rust-owned terrain, water, engineered-ground, and building state. They must not become gameplay
state or hidden repair paths for missing geometry.

Current deterministic rules:

- terrain grass uses world-space UVs and the Grass002 texture stack
- the runtime `grass002_2k_albedo.jpg` and `grass002_2k_height.jpg` imports generate complete
  mipmap chains (11 levels below the 2048x2048 base). Their shader samplers already request
  mipmapped anisotropic filtering; the normal imported-resource path must provide those levels,
  just as the source-image fallback does. Mipmaps are built at import time, with no new per-frame
  CPU work; full-chain texture storage grows by approximately one third
- terrain grass combines macro, mid, and micro layers through stochastic anti-tiling and screen
  footprint fade
- macro / mid / micro grass fading must preserve average luminance; the fade may reduce detail
  contrast but must not accidentally brighten distant terrain or darken close terrain
- any later atmospheric or horizon brightening must be an explicit render effect with its own
  parameters, not an emergent side effect of mip/detail fade
- building-site ground uses the same grass texture stack and world-space material semantics as
  terrain while remaining a separate flat support pad mesh
- authored building asphalt and concrete site surfaces remain separate materials from grass/site
  ground
- water rendering consumes the visible baseline water field and applies a dark Baltic-blue depth
  tint, reaching its deep-water palette by `3.5 m`; increased shallow opacity prevents submerged
  terrain from turning open water muddy, while shoreline foam, restrained Fresnel/sky response,
  and procedural wave normals remain presentation only; the wave field uses rotated aperiodic
  noise octaves with analytic gradients so high camera views do not expose periodic sine bands or
  an axis-aligned sampling grid
- water reflection remains dark in downward views but uses a restrained grazing-angle Fresnel
  response derived from the smooth base surface so procedural normal gradients cannot imprint
  their source cells into the reflected sky; the sun response uses a softened glitter shoulder
  around its bright core, while fine ripple detail remains deferred until a seamless mipmapped
  normal texture is available
- scene lighting is centralized through `scene_lighting.gd` so terrain, water, roads, yards,
  buildings, cars, and debug/editor helpers use one deterministic sun/sky/shadow policy
- the visible background uses one continuous procedural hemisphere gradient; its upper and lower
  halves meet at the same color without literal horizon geometry
- the day/night cycle is a pure function of the operational clock. `day_cycle.gd` maps the day
  fraction to a solar position and a palette; `scene_lighting.gd` applies it. The same clock
  reading always resolves to the same lighting, a paused simulation parks the sun, and no lighting
  state is stored anywhere. `METRUM_TIME_OF_DAY` pins the rendered hour for captures and probe
  trials without touching the simulation
- the sun follows a real solar-position solve for a fixed latitude and declination, so the arc,
  the day length and the length of golden hour follow from two constants instead of hand-placed
  keyframes. Palette stops are keyed to solar elevation, not to the clock, which makes sunrise and
  sunset symmetric and keeps the palette correct if the latitude is retuned
- the key light is one `DirectionalLight3D` that carries the sun by day and an antisolar full moon
  at night. It may only swap bodies inside the window where both contribute nothing, and it must
  never have energy above the horizon crossing, so no light ever shines up through the ground
- terrain and site ground run with `ambient_light_disabled` and bake their own ambient floor into
  `EMISSION`. The cycle therefore scales and desaturates that floor through shader globals;
  dimming alone leaves a saturated ground reading as daylight with the brightness turned down.
  Night bottoms out near a fifth of daylight because the city has no street lighting yet
- the low-sun key energy is deliberately not physical. With no auto-exposure an honestly
  attenuated sun makes golden hour dark instead of golden; the ambient drops at the same stops so
  the result reads as contrast rather than as a brightness change
- palette stop spacing is a continuity budget. The sun crosses the horizon at up to `0.107`
  degrees per authored minute, so a stop gap of `G` degrees carries at most about `0.19 * G` of
  colour change before the transition reads as a wipe. `godot/tests/day_cycle_test.gd` sweeps the
  whole day at one sample per authored minute and enforces this
- `scene_sun_direction`, `scene_sun_color`, `scene_sky_color`, `scene_ambient_strength`,
  `scene_ambient_light` and `scene_ambient_desaturation` are shader globals declared in
  `project.godot`, not per-material parameters. One write per frame relights every resident patch;
  a per-material write would be `O(patches)` per frame and could not follow a moving sun anyway
- the cartographic hillshade baked into terrain and site-ground albedo stays pinned to its authored
  azimuth and altitude. It is a readability device: swinging it with the cycle would double the
  directional light's own shading and would snap 180 degrees at the sun-to-moon swap
- the sky shader places its own sun and moon disks from explicit uniforms rather than from
  `LIGHT0`, so disk brightness and key-light energy can disagree. A sun on the horizon has to stay
  visible after it has stopped being a useful key light, and the moon is not a Godot light
- the cloud panorama is a daylight capture used only as a shape source. Its rotation is fixed and
  its colour comes from the cycle's shadow/light tints; rotating it with the sun would spin the
  whole cloud field around the sky once per day
- the sky uses `PROCESS_MODE_INCREMENTAL` because its palette now changes every frame
- static equirectangular cloud imagery is sampled only as a restrained half-resolution upper-sky
  cover; baked panorama sky color, lower hemisphere, and lighting do not replace the shared
  procedural gradient or directional-light contract
- one shared depth-fog pass fades all ordinary world geometry into the horizon sky color; terrain,
  water, roads, buildings, vehicles, and agents must not implement competing per-material horizon
  cutoffs. Aerial perspective and the far cull curtain are that one ramp, so its colour tracks the
  day cycle and its sun scatter rises at low sun; a uniform haze reads as a flat wall at the
  horizon rather than as light in the air
- shadow policy must be applied through the shared helper rather than per-renderer ad hoc flags
- terrain and site ground receive real shadows; final buildings and cars cast shadows; construction
  pads, debug overlays, and temporary authoring helpers should not cast shadows unless a specific
  debug mode asks for that

Grass mipmap verification (`TERRAIN-02`, 2026-09-10): both imported runtime grass textures
load as `CompressedTexture2D` with 11 mip levels below the base. The same 48-fixture paired
road workload passes with and without GPU profiling on the RX 7900 XTX / i9-12900K,
Godot 4.7.2 Forward+, 1920x1080, 60 FPS cap, V-Sync enabled and 24 Rayon workers. Against the
earlier same-session zero-mip baseline, median periodic GPU time falls `2.978 -> 0.638 ms`;
opaque-pass mean falls `2.789 -> 0.505 ms`. These are one-process diagnostic comparisons,
not uncapped FPS or individual-frame GPU-tail measurements. Matching unprofiled release runs
retain about `16.37 ms` mean observed frame intervals. The user later reported moving windows
between desktops during benchmarking, without identifying affected runs/time ranges. The frame
outliers do not establish a game-side issue, and the exact GPU reduction needs an uninterrupted
repeat with the window stationary. The verified mipmap chains are unaffected. Commands are
`./run.sh --benchmark-gameplay-roads --gpu-profile` and `./run.sh --benchmark-gameplay-roads`,
with the default paired matrix, one warm-up and five measured repetitions. Workload signatures
and library hashes match across states. Build identity, texture hashes, mip probes, commands and
captures are retained in `benchmark-results/grass-mipmaps-dfVqPd/`; the before captures live in
`benchmark-results/gpu-road-analysis-Jecrzy/`. Filtering/grass-scale visual retuning is separate.

The subsequent stationary-window repeat with mipmaps enabled reproduces the low GPU cost:
`0.630 ms` median periodic GPU time, with all 48 fixtures passing in both profiled and unprofiled
runs. Fresh source/import/texture hash checks match the previously verified mip chains. The
unprofiled run still records a `40.742 ms` maximum CPU callback interval, so desktop switching
does not explain all longer intervals. This repeat has no zero-mip baseline and does not settle
the exact speedup or the interval cause. See `roads.md` and
`benchmark-results/stationary-mipmaps-LZ6tB3/results.txt` for the full run conditions and results.

Rendering non-repair rule:

- shader masks, material order, transparency, lighting, water, terrain color, or debug overlays must
  not be used to hide missing road, terrain, water, building, or raised-step topology
- when a visual hole, dark chunk, or wrong overlap appears, the owning mesh/provenance/patch state
  must expose enough debug data to locate the source instead of adding a color workaround

## Implemented Compatibility Gaps We Should Not Extend

The following are live behaviors, but they are not the intended long-term ownership model.

### 1. Dense Scratch Buffers Still Exist In Hot Adjacent Systems

These are compatibility-only.

Current gap:

- terrain renderer upload still materializes one full dense visual-terrain buffer every refresh
- some terrain/water bridge boundaries still materialize dense local patch payloads before handing
  data to Godot

Required direction:

- these paths should later localize to chunk windows or active areas instead of whole-map buffers
- denser authored terrain must not be adopted by extending this whole-map upload path

### 2. Dense Water Snapshots Are Still Used At Save Boundaries

Current gap:

- city saves still persist dense baseline-depth snapshots instead of sparse chunk records

Required direction:

- this refactor may intentionally break existing saves and authored worlds
- no migration is required for the current dense water snapshot layout
- dense runtime water blobs should stay a serialization boundary detail, not the internal ownership
  model

### 3. Undo Is Not Yet Fully Authoritative For Terrain Ownership

Current repository state:

- road edits retain bounded local graph deltas; road undo restores the affected pre-edit compiled
  surface records, removes post-edit owners, and rebuilds old-plus-restored surface, earthwork, and
  query chunks without cold-compiling an unchanged junction; the immutable previous refined
  generation stays reusable, while attached zoning removal uses an index-stable local parcel
  journal rather than cloning the zoning system
- accepted road placement and failed adoption retain an exact touched-storage-chunk visual
  checkpoint, so undo/rollback restores prior visual overrides as well as graph and split references;
  the remaining dense authoring-undo limitation below is separate from `RoadEditPlan`
- road bulldoze and undo queue their graph/surface/terrain work on the simulation thread; the
  Godot input path never performs the road-surface, road-mesh, or refined-CDT rebuild synchronously
- building deletion retains an operation-local inverse journal for touched buildings, sites,
  agents, households, and freight records rather than cloning complete runtime systems
- terrain-authoring and water-authoring undo still capture dense visual terrain or baseline-depth
  snapshots for compatibility with the pre-sparse mutation path

Required direction:

- terrain undo must become authoritative over source terrain and any derived visual state it
  invalidates
- world-authoring workflows must not depend on visual-only terrain snapshots

### 5. Terrain Height Storage Is Still Scaled At Query / Render Boundaries

Current gap:

- terrain samples are still multiplied by `HEIGHT_SCALE` when converted to world-space `y`
- `terrain_base_elevation_m` still enters raw sample storage before that scale is applied

Required direction:

- terrain base elevation and sample values should eventually become direct world-space metres
- no future authored-world format should assume the current scaled-height compatibility contract

### 6. `WorldDefinition` V1 Keeps The First Authored-Water Slice

Current state:

- a dedicated `--world-editor` launch mode and `WorldEditor` scene now exist
- world-editor UI now calls:
  - `create_blank_world`
  - `save_world_definition`
  - `load_world_definition`
- `WorldDefinition` now stores authored baseline-water records and rebuilds deterministic still
  water from them
- `WorldDefinition` still has no richer hydrology ownership beyond the first authored-water slice,
  no preview image, and no richer metadata

Remaining direction:

- the current authored-water slice is the shipped water-authoring baseline and does not require a
  separate richer hydrology system to be considered valid
- richer metadata and optional later water-authoring extensions may still happen, but only if the
  current `Lake Fill` / `Open Water` workflow later proves insufficient

## Implemented Editor / Rendering Slices

### 1. Blank-World WorldEditor V1 Is Live

The first dedicated authored-world shell now exists around `WorldDefinition`.

Current deterministic rules:

- `--world-editor` routes to a dedicated `WorldEditor` scene
- world-editor UI is separate from gameplay save/load UI
- the world-editor top menu exposes:
  - `New World`
  - `Open World`
  - `Save`
  - `Save As`
  - `Quit`
- the world-editor bottom toolbar is the primary authoring surface
- a newly created blank world is dry and flat except for the authored base elevation

### 2. WorldEditor V1 Terrain And Water Authoring Is Live

The current world editor uses the shared `SimulationNode` runtime but does not expose gameplay
simulation controls or gameplay HUD surfaces.

Current deterministic rules:

- world editor starts with the simulation thread available
- world editor does not expose pause / speed controls or gameplay HUD widgets
- world editor terrain authoring is live through:
  - `Raise`
  - `Lower`
  - `Level`
  - `Smooth`
  - `Slope`
- world editor water authoring is live through:
  - `Lake Fill`
  - `Open Water`
- world editor resource authoring is live through:
  - `Coal`
  - `Erase`
- terrain brush picking uses `intersect_terrain()` and therefore targets authored source terrain,
  not the visible engineered surface
- `Raise`, `Lower`, `Level`, `Smooth`, and `Slope` write authoritative source terrain only
- completing a terrain brush stroke rebuilds touched engineered-ground clients and derived terrain
  outputs from the updated source terrain
- terrain brushes must not directly deform road top surfaces, placed flat pads, or future local
  earthwork meshes
- selecting `Raise`, `Lower`, `Level`, `Smooth`, or `Slope` opens a terrain brush submenu on the bottom toolbar
- that terrain brush submenu owns the shared editor `Diameter m` and `Strength` controls
- active terrain brushes show their footprint directly on the terrain so brush diameter is visible before and during sculpting
- `Level` captures the clicked source-terrain height at the start of the brush stroke and moves terrain toward that height while the stroke remains active
- `Smooth` moves terrain toward the local neighborhood average inside the brush footprint and is intended for relaxing jagged cuts, banks, and shorelines after carving
- `Slope` is a two-phase terrain brush:
  - first click captures the slope start anchor and its source-terrain height
  - second click captures the slope end anchor and its source-terrain height
  - after both anchors exist, brushing moves terrain toward the clamped linear grade between those two anchor heights
- `Slope` must not extrapolate beyond the two captured anchors; samples before the first anchor clamp to the start height and samples beyond the second anchor clamp to the end height
- `Lake Fill` and `Open Water` use a preview-first workflow:
  - first click seeds the preview
  - `Surface +m` adjusts the previewed surface
  - `OK` confirms
  - `Cancel` / `Esc` dismisses the preview without writing authored state
- `Coal` paints authored deposit richness into a sparse terrain-aligned resource layer
- the shared Deposits overlay currently renders richer coal deposits darker through terrain overlay mode `4`
- `Erase` clears authored coal cells without modifying terrain height, water, zoning, roads, or
  economy state
- coal deposit rendering must stay shader-overlay based; it must not introduce terrain-following
  mesh decals or CDT geometry just to show authored richness
- world editor save/load is `WorldDefinition` only, not city-save persistence

Current compatibility gap:

- this is not yet the final terrain / water-only runtime boundary
- the shared runtime bundle still contains gameplay systems; world editor simply keeps gameplay
  controls and HUD surfaces absent
- after a terrain stroke, the current runtime still allows placed `Standard` roads to resync to
  edited source terrain; the intended long-term contract is to keep placed roads and future
  foundations fixed and reform terrain / earthworks around them instead

### 3. Baseline Water Is The Required Stable Model

The dynamic source/sink solver has been removed. The shipped water contract is deterministic
authored still water only.

Authoritative rule:

- still water is represented by one baseline-depth layer derived from authored records and terrain

Deterministic baseline-water rules:

- baseline water is authored-world state, not emergent solver output
- `Lake Fill` and `Open Water` are the only shipped water-authoring tools
- each connected baseline water body owns one flat `surface_elevation_m`
- baseline water depth is always derived as:
  - `max(surface_elevation_m - terrain_world_y, 0.0)`
- baseline water does not own velocity or flux buffers
- baseline water is rebuilt from authored records and current terrain
- terrain edits that affect a baseline water body must recompute that baseline body immediately

Deterministic rendering rules:

- renderer consumes baseline depth directly
- visible still water must render as flat at the authored baseline surface elevation
- shader-side waves are cosmetic only and must not require runtime velocity or flux data

Deterministic authored-water rules:

- `Lake Fill` is an authored baseline-water record with:
  - one world-space seed position
  - one target water surface elevation
- `Open Water` is an authored baseline-water record with:
  - one world-space seed position
  - one target water surface elevation
- authored water records belong to `WorldDefinition`, not to renderer state or solver scratch
- `Lake Fill` and `Open Water` preview state remain transient editor runtime state and must never
  be serialized unless confirmed

Deterministic world-load rules:

- loading a `WorldDefinition` must rebuild baseline water from authored `Lake Fill` and
  `Open Water` records
- loading a world must not require running the dynamic shallow-water solver to reconstruct still
  lakes, coasts, or seas

Deterministic preview rules:

- `Lake Fill` preview must show a flat baseline surface preview, not a solver-generated depth field
- `Open Water` preview must show a flat edge-connected baseline surface preview, not a
  solver-generated depth field
- preview validity stays:
  - `Lake Fill` valid only if the filled region stays off the world edge
  - `Open Water` valid only if the filled region reaches the world edge
- confirming a valid preview writes authored baseline-water state only
- canceling the preview restores committed authored baseline water only

Deterministic persistence rules:

- this refactor may intentionally break existing city saves and existing `WorldDefinition` assets
- migration of the current dense water runtime blobs is not required
- the long-term authoritative format must not persist dense runtime water `depth`, `velocity`, and
  `flux` as the definition of still water

Legacy features removed:

- `Source` and `Sink` authoring tools
- dynamic depth, velocity, flux, source lists, and the low-rate runtime water tick
- rebuilding `Lake Fill` or `Open Water` through the old shared runtime solver field
- using the dynamic shallow-water solver to keep authored lakes or seas visually flat
- treating one shared runtime depth field as the source of truth for both authored still water and
  dynamic flowing water

Deterministic non-goals of this refactor:

- no arbitrary freehand water-depth paint brush
- no automatic river extraction from imported DEMs
- no automatic hydrology extraction from hydrography vectors or rasters
- no full river-channel authoring tool yet

### 4. Gameplay `New Game` Now Loads A Selected `WorldDefinition`

Gameplay now has a first-pass authored-world handoff.

Current deterministic rules:

- startup seeds missing bundled world entries from `res://bootstrap/worlds/` into `user://worlds/`
- gameplay `File -> New Game` opens a world picker rooted at `user://worlds/`
- selecting one `WorldDefinition` loads it into the live gameplay scene
- gameplay world load reuses the same scene refresh path as save-load:
  - terrain rebuild
  - water rebuild
  - network mesh refresh
  - building renderer refresh
  - zoning overlay refresh
  - agent renderer refresh
- gameplay pauses immediately after loading the selected world

Remaining direction:

- `New Game` still loads directly into gameplay rather than through a richer front-end menu flow
- city saves must remain runtime snapshots layered on top of that authored world baseline

### 5. Chunk-Local Terrain / Water Rendering Is Now Live

Now that `terrain_cell_m` exists, the live render boundary is chunk-local instead of whole-world.

Authoritative rule:

- whole-map dense mesh and texture refresh is no longer the steady terrain / water render path
- it must not be reintroduced to justify denser authored terrain, larger worlds, or local
  engineered-ground geometry

Deterministic terrain-render rules:

- visible terrain now renders as chunk-local terrain patches rather than one whole-world plane
- terrain render patches follow authored terrain chunk boundaries by default
- if a different terrain render patch span is used later, it must be:
  - derived from `terrain_chunk_m`
  - a fixed integer multiple of `terrain_chunk_m`
  - stable in code rather than camera-dependent
- each terrain render patch owns local GPU resources for that patch only
- rebuilding or uploading one patch may read only:
  - the local visual-terrain window for that patch
  - one fixed border sample ring if needed for interpolation, normals, or shading continuity
  - exact indexed contributor and grading-influence coverage required by local engineered-ground
    clients
- unchanged patches must keep their existing GPU resources
- camera motion alone must not rebuild or reupload already resident unchanged patch textures
- camera motion may change the mesh-detail tier of an already resident patch, but that change must
  reuse the resident patch snapshot and must not fall back to whole-map terrain or water uploads
- only dirty patches and newly required visible patches may rebuild or upload
- the visible terrain patch set must be derived from the camera or editor interest region plus one
  fixed patch of desired-set padding, two resident hysteresis patches, and one speculative prewarm
  patch; at normal height this keeps resident and prepared terrain behind the `8 km` cull boundary
- gameplay uses a `9 km` minimum camera far plane so the full normal-height terrain range is
  renderable; the shared non-volumetric depth fade begins at about `6.2 km` and reaches the sky
  color half a terrain patch before the `8 km` cull boundary
- the depth-fade range follows the terrain renderer's height-scaled cull distance in high-altitude
  WorldEditor views instead of turning into a fixed fog wall above the map
- road earthworks and future engineered-ground clients must continue to invalidate only touched
  terrain chunks; the renderer must reflect that locality instead of reintroducing full-world
  uploads
- asynchronous terrain payload workers may hold the authoritative simulation lock only while
  validating a request revision and copying bounded patch-local terrain/site inputs; road clipping,
  road/site grading, CDT input construction, triangulation, and Godot payload conversion must run
  after that lock is released
- Rayon terrain/water workers must never block or spin waiting for the simulation mutex: an agent
  tick can hold that mutex while waiting for Rayon. Snapshot acquisition uses `try_lock`; contention
  returns the unchanged request through the existing frame-driven retry protocol. Completed refined
  payloads remain queued until nonblocking Godot polling can insert their cache entries with current
  generation checks, before exposing them as ready. Publication is `O(B)` for the completed batch,
  with an `O(1)` busy path; no terrain geometry is rebuilt or discarded merely because the lock is busy
- terrain payload publication revisions are patch-local for local terrain, road, and building-site
  changes; global invalidation is reserved for world-wide source/layout changes; one physical build
  per patch/render-step may be in flight, stale results are rejected, and revision churn coalesces
  into at most one current follow-up build
- terrain/site height sampling and road-footprint collection must use the existing building and
  road-surface ownership indices; full-building or full-road scans are not allowed in patch jobs or
  repeated point queries
- refined terrain divides each render patch into fixed world-aligned bounded CDT core tiles clipped
  to the parent patch; every tile uses exact indexed contributor and required grading-influence
  coverage rather than an assumed fixed-neighbor halo
- tile identity is separate from a full local content fingerprint covering clipped contours and
  provenance, local terrain samples, grading guides/constraints, render step, core bounds, and
  contract revision; unchanged fingerprints reuse immutable compiled geometry and per-tile render
  buffers from the last accepted generation
- each cached tile also retains its road-input clipping: ordered source loops shared across tiles
  and halo contributor loops/manifests. Canonicalization clips ownership to the core while retaining
  the uncut halo for grading shared sides. Reuse compares full geometry/provenance
  (including float bits), exact core bounds, and freshly sampled corner heights in
  `O(local contributor vertices + source edges)` without allocating on a hit. Halo clipping is
  skipped only after this match. Terrain samples, adaptive margins, road/site grading
  guides, and final input fingerprints are still rebuilt; source-generation equality alone cannot
  authorize reuse of visual-terrain inputs. Retention is bounded by cached tiles, with no history
  chain or independent global geometry cache.
- an edit plans `old_coverage union new_coverage` plus deterministic seam-dependency tiles; removed
  contributors omit their old refined coverage so regular terrain fills it again, while unrelated
  tile fingerprints and compiled meshes remain unchanged
- seam invalidation remains cardinal, but only tiles with current road/site contributors enter the
  CDT builder; contributor-free neighbors return to the regular filler, which consumes the exact
  adjacent window side manifest, and contributor coverage/guide generation share one adaptive
  grading-margin probe result
- contributor margin/guide generation and tile-local clipping, sampling, and fingerprint generation
  run as ordered Rayon jobs; deterministic serial aggregation retains canonical tile and manifest
  ordering, keeping total work `O(contributors + windows)` while reducing its wall-clock critical path
- only changed tiles build through Rayon; completed tile results are sorted canonically before patch
  composition so scheduling order cannot change topology or shared seam identity
- road grading guides provide sampling positions, not independent parent-edge height authority.
  They sample the common visual terrain; interior samples inside the required tie-in envelope
  yield to the retained road seam. Shared-side samples remain, graded once against uncut halo
  contributors, so adjacent CDT tiles cannot bridge different elevations. Building pads and
  structural retaining walls retain their own authority. Canonical boundary-cell welding and
  strict core containment prevent sub-millimetre outside samples from expanding the CDT domain.
  Snap guide/source samples within the existing 1 mm side tolerance before testing containment:
  both adjacent tiles must retain the same side point and height, even when its original position
  falls just inside only one tile. More distant halo samples remain excluded.
  Guide points on road constraints are noded with the retained seam's interpolated height.
  Segment incidence tolerances are distances, never fractions of arbitrarily long segments.
  Noded-edge cleanup deduplicates canonical vertex IDs, not nearby segment parameters:
  even sub-millimetre intersections in distinct identity cells must remain on both incident
  boundaries. Otherwise a road/site corner can leave crossing constraints and suppress an
  entire render patch after loading. CDT contract revision `13` includes that noding fix,
  imported-bounds building support, symmetric shared-side sample welding and editor-consistent
  building-part yaw, invalidating earlier oversized/misrotated pads and one-sided apron products;
  Rust and Godot enforce the same revision. Invalid geometry still blocks publication, and both
  `terrain` and `road` debugging expose the renderer's rejection reason.
- successful tile output caches vertices, normals, UVs, offset-ready indices, pre-normalized local
  normal-sum magnitudes, and side-seam manifests; reuse therefore skips triangle conversion,
  window-side vertex scans, and triangle-index normal reconstruction for unchanged tiles
- canonical world-aligned boundary-lattice samples remain local to directly adjacent seam filler;
  only non-lattice geometry breakpoints propagate into patch-wide filler partitions, so adding
  fixed tiles cannot create a Cartesian filler-grid expansion
- atomic composition still copies the complete bounded render-patch mesh because Godot owns one
  surface per patch; concatenation, regular filler, duplicate-normal reconciliation, and upload
  remain `O(patch output vertices + indices)`, while contributor queries, CDT input assembly,
  triangulation, and tile conversion are proportional to changed plus deterministic seam tiles and
  never revisit every connected road in the patch
- refined patch publication is atomic for the exact requested generation; one failed tile, a failed
  road clip query, or missing road ownership on a road-owned patch suppresses the complete new
  payload, stale jobs cannot publish, and the immutable last accepted generation remains visible
  and available for reuse until a complete replacement is accepted
- Godot applies the same transaction boundary across every resident dirty patch in one visual
  batch: it validates exact patch/generation/render-step identity and payload structure, builds
  height textures plus terrain/retaining meshes into inactive resources, and swaps only after every
  dirty payload is stageable. Terrain-only changes and road-coordinated changes use this same path;
  no handled failure is acknowledgement-eligible. Standalone publication rechecks network dirtiness
  and generation after staging, residency additions wait while network publication is pending, and
  transient detached-resource build failures remain retryable in the same generation.
- road insertion also validates the production terrain payloads before accepting simulation state.
  The simulation thread borrows the staged world, rebuilds only affected patch/tile products, and
  stores successful buffers in the existing cache. A failure rolls back graph and split dependents
  before lane, entrance, parcel-maintenance, routing, or treasury changes. GPU staging remains a
  separate generation check; it is no longer the first place a terrain-CDT failure can reject a road.
- a statusless non-engineered payload may use the regular heightmap `PlaneMesh`. An engineered
  payload is renderable only when its current-contract final status is `ok` and its clipped baked
  buffers are structurally valid. Any omitted-pathological-face count rejects the complete patch
  in both Rust readiness and Godot staging: removing a bad face is not a coverage repair.
  `empty`, `failed`, `conflicted`, still-`pathological`, unknown,
  wrong-contract, or malformed engineered output keeps the previous mesh and may not fall back to
  raw terrain.
- a road-locked patch selected through the grading-ray safety pad expands its clip-source query by
  that same render-step / terrain-cell pad; bridge-to-ground transitions cannot mark a neighboring
  patch as road-owned while querying just short of the responsible road seam
- a road loop discovered only through that padded query contributes to a CDT tile only when its
  exact grading influence overlaps positive-area tile core coverage after parent-patch clipping;
  margin-only neighboring loops must not materialize phantom refined coverage
- engineered ownership travels with the Rust payload, and Rust must reject raw-heightmap payload
  requests for known road- or building-site-owned patches even if the renderer's patch-membership
  lookup is stale

Deterministic water-render rules:

- visible water no longer depends on one whole-world depth texture refresh for every change
- water rendering consumes chunk-local bounded window snapshots aligned to the same fixed terrain
  render patch grid
- water patches render from baseline depth only; procedural waves remain shader-side
- resident water patch depth textures are the shared renderer-owned depth source for terrain
  shoreline tint/debug sampling

Deterministic Godot-bridge rules:

- the primary terrain/water render path now uses chunk-local snapshot APIs
- whole-map Godot render APIs such as `get_heightmap_data()`, `get_water_data()`, and
  `get_water_velocity_data()` were removed from the steady-state terrain / water render bridge
- any future dense helper kept for compatibility, debug tooling, or offline export must stay
  outside the steady-state gameplay and WorldEditor render path
- `road` water diagnostics must report authored baseline depth and final visible depth separately
  so dark water-patch regressions identify the owning layer instead of only the final rendered sum
- when a road-touched water patch contains authored baseline water, `road` diagnostics
  must also list the committed `Lake Fill` / `Open Water` records or active preview that actually
  contributed non-zero samples inside that patch
- chunk-local snapshot APIs expose enough metadata for deterministic reconstruction of one
  patch window:
  - patch identity
  - local dimensions
  - world origin
  - `terrain_cell_m`
  - packed sample payloads for that window

Deterministic overlay-separation rule:

- zoning, parcel, or other editor overlays may keep their own representation if that remains cheap
- those overlays must not force terrain or water back onto one whole-world mesh or one whole-world
  texture upload path

Deterministic density gate:

- a default authored-terrain move from `10 m` to `5 m` or finer must not happen before this
  chunk-local terrain / water render split is live
- the density decision must now be re-measured on the split path using the same world-space test
  cases for:
  - system RAM
  - GPU VRAM
  - terrain upload cost
  - water upload cost
  - terrain brush cost
  - earthwork restamp cost
- the accepted road / terrain seam fix is not a density move; it is the Spade CDT terrain-patch
  hardcut in [`roads.md`](roads.md)

Deterministic transition rules:

- future engineered-ground closed local earthwork / tie-in geometry is required whether the
  implementation extends the current terrain runtime or rewrites it
- any terrain-runtime rewrite must still preserve:
  - authoritative source terrain
  - a derived far-field terrain surface outside engineered-ground tie-in boundaries
  - chunk-local invalidation and rebuild boundaries
  - the split terrain / water render-upload path
  - Rust-generated stitched terrain topology anywhere grounded `Standard` road top surfaces own the
    visible surface; the clip boundary is the compiled road-piece outer loop, and shader discard,
    alpha masking, internal road-band clipping, or Godot-side polygon clipping must not be the
    ordinary road seam carrier
  - terrain clipping must be derived from the compiled road-piece outer loop in Rust; asphalt /
    sidewalk render triangles are not reused as terrain ownership triangles
  - span terrain-query footprints are closed in 64 m section-station runs using existing owned
    regions and handoff sources. Internal caps cancel in the patch union; full render/earthwork
    outlines remain unchanged. This bounds exported source loops before the micrometre i32 overlay,
    fixing the 2,790 m `ROAD-14` overflow without reducing precision or relocating the fixture.
    Construction adds one linear boundary pass and O(regions) source storage, not a new spatial index.
  - road-piece and terrain-patch ownership cleanup uses `i_overlay` before triangulation; boolean
    union / difference / hole handling must produce non-overlapping asphalt, sidewalk, and terrain
    regions before Spade receives constraints
  - target road-touched patch generation uses Spade's Rust-side
    `ConstrainedDelaunayTriangulation` with a deterministic `try_bulk_load_cdt` input made from the
    terrain patch rectangle, road-owned footprint constraint loops, and deterministic
    source-terrain sample points outside those footprints
  - conflicting constraints are reported through CDT debug counters and skipped; they are treated
    as geometry bugs to fix at the road-piece source, not as a reason to panic the backend or fall
    back to legacy clipping
  - constraint incidence uses the micrometre road-contour resolution, not the millimetre
    identity grid as an overlap buffer. Distinct near-parallel approach boundaries must not be
    fabricated into overlapping constraints with conflicting heights. Real overlaps and height
    conflicts retain their existing checks; this does not widen height tolerances. The existing
    patch-local noding complexity is unchanged.
  - Spade CDT faces whose centroids are inside road-owned footprints are omitted; all emitted
    terrain triangles must preserve road seam constraint edges and must not cross road footprint
    loops
  - `ghx_constrained_delaunay` is not a terrain backend or fallback in this spec; Spade is the
    production hard-cut target because it gives the project a documented constrained triangulation
    API with exact geometric predicates
  - `robust` is not part of this path for now; standalone exact-predicate code is not needed unless
    a future measured gap remains after `i_overlay` boolean cleanup and Spade CDT
  - current road-touched patch emission uses the Spade CDT path directly; the old subtractive
    triangle cutter, visible seam strip, and conservative cell-triangle ownership rule are no
    longer live fallbacks
  - terrain render suppression for structural local earthwork geometry must remain bounded to true
    geometry overlap rather than acting as a substitute for missing tie-in faces; road-edge terrain
    topology must still be geometrically correct if terrain-side suppression is turned off
  - visible-world query precedence over client-owned top surfaces and closed local earthwork
    geometry
- post-placement terrain edits should rebuild earthworks around already placed client surfaces
  instead of resynchronizing those client surfaces to edited terrain

The chunk-local render path is now the live large-world terrain / water runtime boundary.

#### Road/site corner noding verification (2026-09-11)

`road_site_intersections_near_pad_corners_keep_distinct_vertices` uses an authored 32 m tile
with a sidewalk boundary crossing just inside two flat-pad corners. It fails with the old
split cleanup (two rejected constraints), and passes with identity-only deduplication. It
also checks complete exterior area, no missing constraints, level output, and exact geometry
agreement after contributor reordering. This fix keeps the existing tile-local complexity:
`O(K log K)` sorting and `O(K)` cleanup per edge with K split events, removing the extra
deduplication buffer. No city-wide query or per-agent work is introduced.

Fresh verification: `cargo test --release --lib` passes 1,656 tests (9 intentionally ignored);
headless `road_junction_preview_test.gd` and `network_tool_chunk_renderer_test.gd` pass.
Logs: `/tmp/metrum-chunk-full-tests.log`, `/tmp/metrum-chunk-bridge.log`, and
`/tmp/metrum-chunk-renderer-tests.log`.

Targeted unprofiled measurement uses the same fixture plus 1,089 regular source samples:
24 batches of 50 builds, four warmups, input cloning outside the timed compiler. Command:
`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=24 cargo test --release --lib benchmark_road_site_cdt_noding -- --ignored --nocapture`.
The production release test reports **0.4477 ms/tile**, 763 retained vertices, 1,369 faces,
and zero invalid/missing constraints. Test-binary SHA-256:
`614a167a46dc9fc3bf2c8ef5ca6820d0a156afd194126af9181733074e9cafcc`.

Three matched isolated CDT-module process pairs (`rustc 1.98.1`, `--edition=2024 --test -O`,
identical release Spade/R-tree/overlay dependencies, debug logging disabled, no concurrent
builds/tests) measure old/new medians **0.4816/0.4611**, **0.4828/0.4607**, and
**0.4842/0.4607 ms/tile**. The middle pair reverses process order. Each build runs the serial
tile kernel; outer Rayon scheduling and whole-patch upload are outside this measurement.
The old output has one invalid and three missing constraints, so these are correction-cost
measurements, not an equivalent-output speedup or a city-scale FPS claim. Harnesses and logs:
`/tmp/metrum-cdt-{before,after}/harness.rs`, `/tmp/metrum-chunk-kernel-{before,after}-*.log`,
and `/tmp/metrum-chunk-kernel-production.log`. Matched binary SHA-256 prefixes:
`9c810e195d67e7d5` (before), `3952a9f86230267ee` (after).

#### Shared-side yard seam verification (2026-09-11)

A commercial apron exposed a 0.276727 m vertical T-junction across a 64 m tile side. A grading
sample less than 1 mm inside one tile snapped onto that side, while the neighbor rejected it
before snapping and retained an unsplit edge at a different height. Canonicalization now welds
samples first and enforces strict containment afterwards. This adds no allocations, spatial
queries or city-wide work: constant work per local source/guide sample, with existing CDT costs.
Flat pads and authored assets are unchanged; Rust/Godot contract revision 12 invalidates old meshes.

`adjacent_tiles_share_near_boundary_grading_samples_from_either_side` failed before the fix and
passes afterwards. Its 64 cases cover both axes, positive/negative large-world coordinates, both
offset directions and source/guide inputs. It compares referenced side vertices and heights;
the containment regression also proves that farther halo samples stay excluded.

Fresh release verification passes **1,659 Rust tests (9 ignored)**, including the 61 CDT tests,
plus headless `road_junction_preview_test.gd` and `network_tool_chunk_renderer_test.gd`. The
read-only loaded scene publishes all eight requested patches; its repaired point is referenced
by triangles on both sides at exactly the same height. A local rendered-triangle incidence audit
changes from one >1 cm disagreement to zero (maximum residual under 5 mm with 1 mm XZ incidence
tolerance). The neighboring frontage still passes 99 probes, maximum paired difference 6.5 mm.
Neither assets, the diagnostic save nor the checked-in terrain fixture were modified. Logs:
`/tmp/metrum-yard-seam-{red,cdt-tests,full-tests,scene,bridge,renderer}.log` and
`/tmp/metrum-yard-seam-{before,after}-audit.log`. Full-suite command from repository root:
`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=24 rust/target/release/deps/metrum_rise-9cc8d57998aa4451 --test-threads=8`.

Matched, unprofiled release timing (`rustc 1.98.1`, Cargo release profile, debug flags unset,
`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=24`, no concurrent builds/tests) reuses `benchmark_road_site_cdt_noding` above.
Three before/after process pairs give **0.4516/0.4463**, **0.4493/0.4477**, and
**0.4483/0.4477 ms/tile**; the middle pair reverses order. All outputs retain 763 vertices,
1,369 faces and zero invalid/missing constraints. No kernel regression is apparent in this fixture;
these small differences are not a general speedup claim.

The existing `populated_paved_road_plan_scaling` also passes one matched process pair, 100 measured
edits plus three warmups per population, with fixed local sites and identical local products at
every background size within each build. Worker p50 milliseconds, before/after:

| Remote buildings | Remote roads | Agents | Before / after |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 0 | 24 | 21.45 / 23.50 |
| 1,000 | 4 | 6,024 | 21.55 / 22.85 |
| 10,000 | 40 | 60,024 | 22.39 / 22.60 |
| 100,000 | 391 | 600,024 | 22.76 / 22.54 |

Current readiness p50 stays below 0.020 ms; one-time snapshot cost is separate (0.007–3.312 ms).
This verifies locality, not an end-to-end speedup: one pair cannot attribute the small-map timing
variation. Commands for each retained release test binary use
`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=24 <binary> <benchmark_name> --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1`.

### 6. Offline Heightmap / DEM Import Is Live

Authoritative rule:

- imported terrain writes authoritative source terrain only
- visual terrain is always derived from source terrain plus later structural road or water
  derivations; ordinary grounded road seams are generated as CDT patch meshes

Current implemented slice:

- real-map terrain import now exists as an offline editor-time tool:
  - `tools/import_dem_world_definition.py`
- the importer writes a normal `WorldDefinition` SQLite asset directly
- the first validated source case is the National Land Survey of Finland Kuopio `324 km²`
  `Korkeusmalli 2 m` tile batch under:
  - `maps/raw/Kuopio/324km2/`
- the default generated authored world is:
  - `maps/processed/Kuopio/kuopio_324km2_10m.sqlite`

Current source format rules:

- v1 import accepts raster DEM/DTM data in single-band `GeoTIFF`
- the first concrete target source class is tiled National Land Survey of Finland elevation data
  such as `Korkeusmalli 2 m`:
  - single-band `Float32`
  - projected horizontal CRS
  - explicit pixel size in metres
  - explicit `NoData` value
- v1 does not accept:
  - hillshade rasters
  - hydrography rasters
  - RGB orthoimagery
  - arbitrary grayscale PNG/JPEG images
  - mixed DEM/DSM source batches

Current ownership rules:

- DEM import is world-editor only
- the current importer creates a new `WorldDefinition`; it does not merge into an already edited
  world
- imported terrain becomes the new authoritative source terrain for that world extent
- runtime coordinates remain centred world-local metres after import; source georeferencing is not
  preserved as gameplay-space coordinates
- import provenance may be stored as non-authoritative metadata, but gameplay must not depend on it
- because the live runtime still multiplies terrain samples by `HEIGHT_SCALE` at render/query
  boundaries, the importer currently converts DEM elevation metres into that pre-scaled runtime
  sample space before writing source terrain

Deterministic validation rules:

- every selected source file must be readable and must expose georeferencing metadata
- all selected tiles in one import batch must share:
  - the same projected horizontal CRS
  - the same pixel size
  - the same sample type
  - the same north-up axis orientation
- v1 must reject source rasters with rotation / skew terms
- v1 must reject missing or malformed `NoData` metadata
- v1 must reject overlapping tiles that do not align exactly on pixel boundaries
- v1 must reject any selected crop extent that contains `NoData` inside the requested world area
- v1 must reject target `terrain_cell_m` values finer than the source raster pixel size; the
  importer must not invent terrain detail by upsampling to a finer authored resolution

Current deterministic import sequence:

1. select one or more `GeoTIFF` DEM tiles
2. validate source metadata and pixel-grid compatibility
3. mosaic the source tiles into one temporary import raster in source CRS
4. choose a rectangular import extent inside that mosaic
5. create a new `WorldConfig` for the imported world:
   - `width_m` and `height_m` come directly from the chosen import extent
   - `terrain_cell_m` is user-selected but must be `>=` source pixel size
   - `terrain_chunk_m` follows the normal authored-world chunk rules
   - `terrain_base_elevation_m` stays an authored-world default only; it must not be used to
     reinterpret imported heights
6. resample the import raster into the authored terrain grid in canonical world metres
7. write the resampled values into authoritative source terrain
8. reset visual terrain from source terrain
9. save the result as a normal `WorldDefinition`

Current deterministic resampling rules:

- resampling happens at terrain sample positions, not cell centres of a separate import-only grid
- v1 uses bilinear interpolation from source DEM values
- border-only nodata introduced by edge-aligned resampling is clamped from the nearest interior
  valid sample; any remaining nodata after that is a hard rejection
- source elevation values are numerically preserved apart from that resampling step; v1 does not
  apply erosion, exaggeration, or artistic normalization during import
- vertical datum conversion is out of scope for v1; import assumes the source height values are
  already the desired authored elevations

Allowed compatibility boundary:

- DEM import may materialize one dense temporary mosaic and one dense target raster because import
  is an offline editor operation, not a hot simulation path

Explicit non-goals of v1 DEM import:

- automatic extraction of rivers, lakes, or hydrology from the DEM
- automatic terrain texturing or biome painting
- importing hydrography vectors/raster as water gameplay state
- preserving external CRS coordinates as live gameplay-space coordinates
- patch-importing one DEM over part of an already edited authored world

Remaining direction:

- integrate DEM import into the WorldEditor UI instead of keeping it as an offline tool only
- remove the importer's current dependency on the pre-`HEIGHT_SCALE` runtime compatibility layer

## Remaining Planned Deterministic Implementation

The remaining slices below are still intended next steps.

### 7. Optional Future: Richer Water Authoring

The current authored-water model is sufficient as the shipped baseline:

- `Lake Fill`
- `Open Water`

We do not currently require a separate richer hydrology layer beyond that baseline.

If richer water authoring is ever added later, the rules should remain:

- any richer river/channel ownership stays separate from raw terrain elevation
- richer water authoring must not be stored as "just paint some water depth into the live runtime
  buffer"
- imported hydrography may be used as an editor reference, but not as implicit gameplay water state
- imported DEMs and imported hydrography remain separate inputs; one does not silently create the
  other
- the current `Lake Fill` / `Open Water` workflow remains valid even if no richer river-path
  tooling is ever added

### 8. Use A Hybrid Water Model For Very Large Worlds

The intended large-world water model is hybrid.

Deterministic rules:

- the current authored-water baseline defines still water bodies for the whole
  world
- local active areas may run dynamic water simulation later only if a new bounded flow design is
  added
- the engine must not require a full-world dense shallow-water solve for every map size

### 9. Keep The First Terrain / Water Realism Pass Render-Only

Terrain and water should look more natural, but the first realism pass must stay strictly on the
render side.

Deterministic rules:

- the first terrain/water realism pass must work in both gameplay and WorldEditor from the same
  live terrain and water buffers
- the first realism pass must not require external base textures
- the first realism pass must not add authored-material data to `WorldDefinition`
- the first realism pass must not add visual-material data to city saves
- realism tuning should live in renderer/shader parameters, not in simulation state
- terrain realism may derive from:
  - world elevation
  - slope / local normal
  - procedural hillshade
  - shoreline proximity
  - low-frequency procedural color breakup
- water realism may derive from:
  - water depth
  - shoreline proximity
  - view-angle / fresnel-like response
  - small procedural surface breakup
- coastline smoothing may be handled visually with soft shoreline masking, shoreline foam bands,
  or similar shader-side treatment
- on coarse authored grids such as `10 m`, shoreline improvement should prefer sub-texel render
  coverage / contour-style masking before increasing `terrain_cell_m` density
- these visual passes must never change:
  - source terrain
  - visual terrain ownership rules
  - authored water records
  - runtime baseline water depth state
  - save schema

Deterministic v1 realism scope:

- terrain should move away from one flat height-color ramp toward:
  - slope-aware rock versus soil/vegetation weighting
  - stronger relief readability from hillshade
  - shoreline color transitions
  - subtle macro variation so large areas are not one uniform tint
- water should move away from one flat translucent surface toward:
  - shallow-versus-deep color separation
  - stronger coast readability
  - view-angle-dependent reflectance / specular response
  - mild procedural breakup so calm water does not look perfectly flat
- the first realism pass must stay cheap enough to share the existing terrain/water renderer path
  between gameplay and WorldEditor

Deterministic terrain color ownership after the first realism pass:

- the long-term terrain color model must be surface-classification-first and absolute-height-second
- absolute world elevation may still influence the palette, but it must not be the primary terrain
  material classifier
- the primary terrain color inputs should be derived from the live visible terrain field:
  - slope / local normal
  - local relief / ruggedness
  - shoreline or visible-water proximity
  - narrow shore-transition cues derived from visible water, not only from `0 m`
  - macro variation / large-scale breakup
- absolute world elevation should be treated as a secondary modifier that nudges an already chosen
  surface class rather than choosing the surface class by itself
- default dry terrain must read as normal inland ground / forest floor, not as marsh, shoreline,
  or tidal flats just because it is low or near one of many lakes
- shoreline influence should remain a relatively narrow visual transition near visible water, not a
  dominant lowland terrain class
- imported DEM worlds and hand-authored blank worlds must share the same terrain-color ownership
  model; terrain color must not assume a specific real-world altitude band such as Kuopio's
  imported range
- the renderer may still use absolute elevation to bias:
  - colder / harsher upland tones
  - alpine / snow transition
  - gentle broad lowland hue shifts where appropriate
  but those biases must remain weaker than the primary surface-classification cues
- the terrain-color model must remain render-only and must not introduce authored material records,
  biome records, or save-schema changes
- the terrain-color model must remain cheap enough to share the same terrain renderer path between
  gameplay and WorldEditor

Deterministic shoreline contour rendering slice:

- on coarse authored grids such as `10 m`, the preferred next shoreline-quality step is contour
  extraction from the live visible water field, not additional blur radius and not a denser
  authored map by default
- shoreline contour extraction must remain render-only and must never become authored world state
- the extraction input must be the same composed visible water depth used by the water renderer:
  baseline water after terrain alignment
- shoreline extraction must use a waterline threshold at the visible shoreline boundary, not a
  post-hoc artistic painted mask
- the extraction algorithm may be marching squares or an equivalent contour/isoband method, but
  the output contract is:
  - smoother diagonal coastlines than raw cell edges
  - smoother narrow channel shorelines than raw cell edges
  - no visible whole-cell stair stepping as the primary shoreline shape in common camera views
  - shoreline position must stay tied to the live water field, not drift arbitrarily for style
- the renderer may realize that contour result as either:
  - a dedicated shoreline mesh
  - a higher-resolution shoreline mask or distance field
  - another equivalent render-only contour representation
- whichever render representation is chosen, it must update whenever terrain or visible water is
  refreshed in gameplay or WorldEditor
- the shoreline contour slice must not require any save-schema change, `WorldDefinition` schema
  change, or additional authored shoreline records
- sub-texel shoreline coverage smoothing remains an allowed fallback/interim treatment, but it is
  not the long-term primary shoreline-quality solution on coarse grids
- shoreline contour rendering may improve the visible water edge only; it does not create
  sub-cell terrain-bank geometry and must not pretend to solve blocky terrain cuts by itself

Deterministic cliff breakline / cliff band rendering slice:

- on coarse authored grids such as `10 m`, the preferred next cliff-quality step is render-only
  cliff extraction from the live terrain field, not manual authored cliff painting and not a
  denser authored map by default
- cliff rendering must remain render-only and must never become authored world state
- the extraction input must be the same live visible terrain field used by terrain rendering after
  terrain refresh, plus its derived slope / local-normal information
- cliff detection must classify steep terrain from the live terrain field, not from a post-hoc
  artist-painted mask
- the extraction algorithm may use slope thresholds, hysteresis, marching squares, contour
  extraction, or another equivalent method, but the output contract is:
  - one upper cliff breakline tied to the visible terrain top edge
  - one lower cliff breakline tied to the visible terrain toe / bottom edge
  - one rendered cliff-face band or equivalent representation between those two lines
  - smoother diagonal cliff edges than raw cell silhouettes in common camera views
  - visibly stronger cliff readability than the current raw terrain mesh alone
  - no arbitrary drift away from the live terrain field for style
- the renderer may realize that cliff result as either:
  - a dedicated cliff ribbon / band mesh
  - a higher-resolution cliff mask or distance field
  - another equivalent render-only breakline representation
- whichever render representation is chosen, it must update whenever visible terrain is refreshed
  in gameplay or WorldEditor
- the cliff rendering slice must not require any save-schema change, `WorldDefinition` schema
  change, or additional authored cliff records
- cliff rendering may darken or re-shade the cliff face, but that shading must remain derived from
  the live terrain field and must not introduce authored material ownership
- cliff rendering improves visible cliff readability only; it does not create sub-cell terrain
  geometry and must not pretend to solve coarse side silhouettes by itself

Deterministic terrain-border skirt rendering slice:

- the preferred map-edge treatment is a render-only terrain-border skirt derived from the live
  terrain edge, not authored border geometry and not simulation-owned world walls
- terrain-border skirt rendering must remain render-only and must never become authored world
  state
- the skirt input must be the same live visible terrain field used by terrain rendering after
  terrain refresh
- the skirt must be built from the outer terrain edge of the current world and extruded downward
  to one fixed render-only depth
- the terrain-border skirt output contract is:
  - the map edge reads as a visible cut through the terrain instead of a paper-thin plane
  - contour lines or equivalent elevation bands visibly continue down the side surface
  - the skirt stays aligned to the live terrain edge and updates whenever terrain visuals refresh
  - the top terrain surface remains the authoritative playable surface; the skirt is presentation
    only
- the renderer may realize that skirt result as either:
  - one dedicated side-wall mesh plus one bottom cap
  - one equivalent render-only border representation
- whichever render representation is chosen, it must update whenever visible terrain is refreshed
  in gameplay or WorldEditor
- the terrain-border skirt slice must not require any save-schema change, `WorldDefinition` schema
  change, or additional authored border records
- the skirt material may use contour lines, sediment-style depth banding, or other earth-layer
  cues, but those cues must remain render-only and derived from the live terrain field
- the terrain-border skirt may improve the perceived thickness and readability of the map edge
  only; it must not introduce playable vertical terrain, collision ownership, or simulation-owned
  edge walls

Deterministic asset policy:

- external terrain/water material textures are optional later enhancements, not a prerequisite for
  the first realism pass
- if material textures are added later, they remain visual assets only
- authored worlds and imported DEM worlds must remain valid and usable even when no external
  material textures are present

Explicit non-goals of the first realism pass:

- authored material painting
- biome simulation
- erosion or sediment simulation for visual purposes
- dependency on downloaded hillshade rasters
- dependency on scanned PBR material libraries before terrain/water can look acceptable
- increasing `terrain_cell_m` density solely to get a smoother visible shoreline before contour
  rendering has been attempted
- increasing `terrain_cell_m` density solely to get smoother visible cliff edges before
  breakline/band rendering has been attempted
- adding authored border-wall geometry or persistence merely to make the map edge look thicker
- using one absolute-height ramp as the long-term primary terrain material classifier

## Current Deterministic Non-Goals

The following are explicitly not implemented yet and should not be assumed by other systems:

- interactive WorldEditor DEM / GeoTIFF import UI
- optional richer river-path / channel authoring beyond the current water tool set
- chunk-streamed terrain renderer
- chunk-window water simulation
- explicit atmospheric / horizon brightening independent from terrain material detail fade
- authoritative terrain undo across source plus derived state
- direct-metre terrain height storage without `HEIGHT_SCALE`

## Implementation Guardrails

These rules must stay true as the terrain/world system grows:

- source terrain is authoritative; derived terrain is never the only source of truth
- sparse chunk-backed storage is the resting runtime representation
- dense buffers are boundary tools, not the runtime ownership model
- new terrain import or authoring paths must write authoritative source terrain
- old save migration is not required unless a future change explicitly decides otherwise
- large-world support must avoid whole-world dense simulation assumptions

## Short Version

What is implemented now:

- `WorldConfig` replaced the legacy map config
- `terrain_cell_m` exists and terrain/water sample density is independently configurable
- runtime world-space XZ is canonical metres again
- terrain and water are sparse chunk-backed at rest
- terrain keeps authoritative source plus derived visual buffers
- water keeps sparse baseline depth at rest
- blank-world `WorldDefinition` exists as a separate authored-world asset
- authored world load resets runtime state to a fresh blank city baseline
- offline DEM import can now generate a normal `WorldDefinition` from real GeoTIFF elevation tiles
- first authored-water tools are live in WorldEditor through `Lake Fill` and `Open Water`
- `WorldDefinition` now persists inland lake fills and edge-connected open-water fills
- live water now keeps authored baseline still water only; the dynamic flowing-water prototype was
  removed
- save/load and renderer boundaries still use dense materialization
- terrain shoreline/debug water sampling now binds the Water renderer's resident patch depth
  texture directly instead of materializing a second terrain-aligned water texture
- water mesh refresh now uses async Rust/Rayon preparation plus a Rust-owned ready queue,
  Godot-side ready polling, pending-job backpressure, stale road/depth signature rejection, and a
  measured time/byte apply budget, with indexed buffers for fully wet unclipped patches, shared
  Godot `ArrayMesh` reuse for matching full-grid variants, and Godot-side stale queue compaction
  guided by request/cache/job perf counters; ready polling is adaptive and fills a bounded
  camera-sorted apply queue, ready/apply drainage receives a conservative headroom boost only while
  backlog is high, and the mesh refresh scheduler polls ready work, applies ready uploads, then
  submits new work last so cache-hit request work does not compete with expensive `ArrayMesh`
  uploads in the same frame
- terrain/water non-mesh patch payloads for residency, speculative prewarm, and resident dirty
  uploads now prepare asynchronously in Rust and are polled by Godot before main-thread resource
  apply; patch texture uploads consume Rust-provided byte payloads, regular terrain mesh variants
  are prewarmed by active layout, terrain/water patch resources are pooled/prewarmed before first
  visible residency activation, water prewarms shared full-grid `ArrayMesh` variants, and perf
  summaries include render stats for viewport, draw calls, primitives, memory buckets, vsync,
  FPS cap, and resource-pool counters; refined terrain preparation snapshots only bounded local
  inputs under the simulation lock, performs road/site grading and CDT work off-lock, and uses
  patch-local revisions with one physical in-flight build per patch/render-step. Road-loop source
  attribution uses a sorted exact-edge index before its metric-overlap fallback, and canonical CDT
  skips source-vertex recovery only after proving every source endpoint is already represented
- gameplay world-load refresh leaves terrain/water/network revisions dirty until the renderers
  acknowledge the exact payloads and road mesh they actually uploaded; resident terrain batches
  are prevalidated and staged as detached/inactive resources before an atomic scene swap
- terrain and water patch residency plus speculative cache prewarm now use elapsed-time budgets
  with camera-prioritized patch order; water follows terrain's resident-set revision for the
  steady-state no-change path, and terrain/water mesh-LOD refreshes plus terrain-to-water texture
  sync drain through time-budgeted queues instead of sweeping every resident patch in one frame
- terrain/water activation removes out-of-window patches farthest-first, drains downstream texture /
  LOD / mesh queues closest-first, and exports residency add/remove/pending counters for streaming
  perf captures
- ready terrain and water residency can each activate at most `12` patches per frame and stop after
  `4 ms`; this is still `O(k)` with `k <= 12`, while cached/cheap rotation handoffs are no longer
  forced through the old two-patch-per-frame bottleneck
- ordinary terrain payload requests may enqueue `32` camera-prioritized patches per frame; refined
  road/site terrain retains its separate two-request cap so faster raw streaming does not flood the
  expensive CDT path
- ready water mesh uploads apply at most `4` patches normally or `6` only under the existing
  measured-headroom boost, with `2.5/3.5 ms` and `1.4/2.2 MB` time/byte limits respectively
- terrain/water LOD refreshes are movement-gated and cap checked/changed patches per frame so
  periodic LOD validation does not rescan or rebuild the whole resident set in one frame; new
  movement-triggered resident sweeps replace stale pending sweep entries and expose replaced-count
  counters so queue buildup is measurable, and resident sweeps only enqueue patches whose target
  LOD/subdivision differs from current state while reporting skipped-count counters; baked/CDT
  terrain patches skip no-op LOD mesh rebuilds, and speculative terrain/water prewarm now covers
  only a bounded halo around the resident/activation region
- terrain rendering now derives hillshade procedurally from the live heightmap in both gameplay
  and WorldEditor; it is not stored as separate world data
- terrain and water rendering now use a first render-only realism pass with slope-aware terrain
  shading, shoreline-aware terrain tinting, depth-aware water color, and shader-side shoreline /
  fresnel / procedural breakup treatment, including contour-style shoreline rendering on the
  existing `10 m` grid from the live visible water field plus render-only cliff breakline / cliff
  band treatment from the live terrain field
- terrain grass and building-site grass now use the same Grass002 material stack with world-space
  UVs, stochastic anti-tiling, and luminance-preserving detail fade so camera distance changes
  reduce detail contrast rather than changing base brightness
- centralized scene lighting now provides a deterministic procedural hemisphere sky, static
  texture-derived upper-sky cloud cover, a terrain-range-aware far-distance fade, and a shared
  directional sun / shadow baseline for terrain, site ground, buildings, cars, roads, water, and
  editor/debug helpers
- terrain coloring now uses surface classification first and absolute height second, so flat blank
  worlds and imported DEM worlds share the same inland-first palette model instead of depending
  mainly on one absolute-height ramp
- terrain-border skirt rendering now adds a render-only side wall plus bottom cap derived from the
  live terrain edge, with contour continuation, noise-warped earth strata, distance-faded surface
  relief, and a shallow irregular topsoil lip so maps read as a visible cut through terrain instead
  of a paper-thin top plane
- water rendering now also adds a render-only edge curtain where visible water reaches the map
  boundary, so outside-of-map views do not expose the submerged terrain plane through the
  transparent water surface

What is next:

1. interactive DEM / GeoTIFF import UI for real-map authored worlds
2. dedicated shoreline mesh or distance-field rendering if the current contour-style shoreline
   field still is not enough for close camera work
3. chunk-window runtime processing
4. later texture-assisted terrain/water materials if the shader-only realism pass is not enough

Optional later only:

- richer river-path / channel authoring if the current water-tool workflow later proves
  insufficient for map making
