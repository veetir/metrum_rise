# distance asks for, and that error is up to 361 m. Two rules follow, and both were broken
# before this was measured from a ground-level camera:
#   - A band must be wider than the patch diagonal, or one patch spans several bands and
#     the level it draws is wrong for most of what it contains. Only TREE_NEAR_M is a band
#     now: the two crown levels share one instance and TREE_MID_M picks its mesh per patch.
#   - A range must be longer than the patch half-diagonal, or the patch under the camera
#     can be culled while the plants at the camera's feet are still in view.
