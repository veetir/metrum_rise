## Deterministic day/night lighting palette sampled from the operational clock.
##
## [method sample_into] is a pure function of the day fraction: the same fraction always
## resolves to the same sun position and the same colours, with no engine state, no wall
## clock and no randomness. [code]scene_lighting.gd[/code] owns applying the result to the
## scene; this file owns only the curve, so the palette stays headlessly testable and can be
## retuned without touching the renderer.
##
## The sun follows a real solar-position solve for a fixed latitude and declination, so the
## arc, the day length and the length of the golden hour are consequences of one pair of
## constants rather than hand-placed keyframes. Colours are keyed to the resulting solar
## elevation, not to the clock, which makes sunrise and sunset symmetric for free and keeps
## the palette correct if the latitude is ever retuned.

# session. A seasonal sweep is a separate feature, not a prerequisite for this one.
