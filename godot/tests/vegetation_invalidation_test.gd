## Headless contract test for per-patch vegetation invalidation after a world edit.
## Trees are a derived product of the terrain surface, so a patch must regenerate when
## the terrain renderer commits a newer surface generation for that patch only.
##
## The vegetation grid is finer than the terrain grid, so "that patch only" now means every
## sub-patch the edited terrain patch owns and no sub-patch of any other. Both generations
## are still published per terrain patch, which is what makes the invalidation conservative.
